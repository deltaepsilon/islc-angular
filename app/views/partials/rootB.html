        <h2 class="sub-head">Join over 1,400 students who have <br> learned calligraphy from Melissa since 2009</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <p class="legible">
            You will learn to letter beautiful envelopes, invitations, save-the-dates, love letters and scrapbook
            layouts. Melissa's students have used calligraphy to supplement their design, photography and event planning
            businesses.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <p class="legible">
            There is no easy way to learn calligraphy.  It takes practice, just like every valuable
            skill. However, calligraphy is not nearly as difficult as it first appears. Melissa has personally taught
            well over <strong>1,400 students</strong> how to letter since 2009, and her online teaching methodology has proven to be an
            efficient way for students to <strong>start lettering immediately</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <p class="legible">
            The course starts with an overview of the supplies that you will need to get started. Then you'll use
            Melissa's custom practice guides to trace the letterforms with a pencil. From the pencil, you progress
            to pointed pen work, tracing letterforms and eventually forming words and positioning those words on the page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <p class="legible">
            The class's secret sauce is Melissa's totally unique <strong>feedback gallery</strong>.
            As you complete your assignments, you will upload snapshots of your work to your personal
            feedback gallery. You can use the gallery to ask Melissa any questions that you have.
            Melissa will review your work, answer your questions and give you suggestions for improvement.
            This form of <strong>one-on-one coaching</strong> will accelerate your learning far faster than
            reading and practice guides alone.

                Thanks so much for putting your heart into your calligraphy class, Melissa.  It was so much fun to take and such a confidence booster!  You girls don't know how much inspiration and drive you put in us.  I can be having the worst day, and see a DIY or calligraphy project on
                <a class="button-link" href="http://melissaesplin.com" target="_blank">ISLY</a>, and my creative gears start turning...  Really!  Keep up the great work.  I hope I'm right there along with you someday!

                So I have one day left with the course and I just wanted to tell you how much I have loved it!  I haven't submitted everything I have done, but all of the information has been so helpful and so informative.  I learned calligraphy in my 7th grade art class (a long, long, long time ago) and I was in love from the start.  It became a long-forgotten hobby over the years, so thank you for reminding me how much I love calligraphy.
            </p>
            <p class="legible">
                I do have to say that this is the first time I have used the nib.  I have always used calligraphy markers, but the pen and ink is so much more artistic and beautiful.  I will never use a marker again.  ;)  I will whole heartily recommend this course to others.
