### In this lesson, you will learn the basic directions on how to take the miniscules and majuscules from the previous lesson and incorporate them into forming the words. You will practice the letters with both a pencil and the pointed pen.

Now that you have your basic strokes worked out, you’ll want to move onto forming the actual letters. You’ll find that the letters in the copperplate style are not much different than the cursive letters you practiced in school. Cursive originated from Copperplate calligraphy, so thank the third grade for making this much easier.

When forming your letters, typically uppercase, it might be a little tricky to figure out where to start. As a general rule of thumb, you start from the top left corner and work your way down. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but as you practice on your worksheet, you’ll find that even the rogue letters do follow a similar pattern as far as the construction is concerned.

Much like pronouncing a word with the right emphasis on each syllable, thick strokes emphasize and give structure to your lettering.

Notice how changes in emphasis affect the letterform. Keep this in mind as you learn to deconstruct each letter and look for clues on where to start each stroke.

# Upload Guidelines

*  Scans are okay, but to save me time from downloading and opening with a third party app, please snap a photo or **save as a JPG**. 
*  Snapping a photo in natural light or a well-lit area will give me the most information to work off of. 
*  Try to keep uploads to one page (or one photo) per assignment. Seeing the whole exercise at a glance helps me provide you with more feedback.
*  Be descriptive! Include information on **nib**, **ink**, **paper**, any issues or concerns and if you're a **lefty**. I can give more specific feedback based on those details.

    <p>
      Once you’ve mastered the basic strokes, it's time to move onto the alphabet! Trace or free-hand the alphabet in pencil. The goal of this exercise is to get you comfortable with structure, stroke order and pressure. As you work your way down the alphabet, you’ll find that each letter looks better than the next. <b>Circle letters you may be struggling with.</b> Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.

    </h2>
    <p>
      After you feel comfortable with penciling the alphabet, grab a piece of calligraphy paper and while looking (no tracing!) at the alphabet as a guide, practice each letter a few times. You may want to draw out angle lines to make your practice look neat. <b>Circle letters you may be struggling with.</b> Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.
