### In this lesson, you will learn the basic directions on how to take the miniscules and majuscules from the previous lesson and incorporate them into forming the words. You will practice the letters with both a pencil and the pointed pen.

Now that you have your basic strokes worked out, you’ll want to move onto forming the actual letters. You’ll find that the letters in the copperplate style are not much different than the cursive letters you practiced in school. Cursive originated from Copperplate calligraphy, so thank the third grade for making this much easier.

When forming your letters, typically uppercase, it might be a little tricky to figure out where to start. As a general rule of thumb, you start from the top left corner and work your way down. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but as you practice on your worksheet, you’ll find that even the rogue letters do follow a similar pattern as far as the construction is concerned.

Much like pronouncing a word with the right emphasis on each syllable, thick strokes emphasize and give structure to your lettering.

Notice how changes in emphasis affect the letterform. Keep this in mind as you learn to deconstruct each letter and look for clues on where to start each stroke.

      Once you’ve mastered the basic strokes with your pencil or paintbrush, it’s time to move on to the pointed pen! Slide your alphabet worksheet underneath a new sheet of tracing paper and practice each letter. Don’t worry about any shaking that might occur. The goal of this exercise is to get you comfortable with pressing and releasing with your pen and comfortable with the order of each stroke. As you work your way down the alphabet, you’ll find that each letter looks better than the next. Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.

      After you feel comfortable with tracing the alphabet, grab a piece of calligraphy paper and while looking (no tracing!) at the alphabet as a guide, practice each letter at least 5 times. You may want to graph out lines to make your practice look neat. Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.
