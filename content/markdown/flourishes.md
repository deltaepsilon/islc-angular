### In this lesson, you will learn the basics of appropriately adding flourishes to a word or project as well as the basics to make your own impromptu flourish shapes.

Flourishes are a fun way to add a lot of punch to a project. I look at flourishes like the dessert course of a fantastic meal. Flourishes are best when used in small doses like at the beginning or end of a word.

There are three places that work best for adding flourishes:

1. for punctuation or crossing t’s and dotting i’s
2. at the beginning and/or ending of a word or line
3. underneath or around a word or phrase


Flourishes should add more dynamics to the word or phrase, not decrease readability. Use flourishes in small doses.

The basic flourish strokes as seen above can be added with one another in a wide variety of ways.

Above are some examples of how to incorporate the basic flourish strokes with one another. When writing with ornate styling, I typically steer away from dramatic thicks and thins in flourishes to create a hierarchy between the word and the flourish.

    <p>
      Practice the three basic flourish strokes, explore combining them with a pencil (no need to upload this exploration). Pick a word, ideally a word with an ascender and descender, and letter the word down the page without intro strokes, cross strokes or terminal strokes (see #1 in example above). Explore the different ways to flourish that word. <b>Highlight areas you like and don't like.</b> Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.
