### In this lesson, you’ll learn the whats and whys of outfitting yourself with the correct tools and the perfect lettering environment.

You should have your supplies in front of you. If not, head over to [Paper and Ink Arts](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+istilllovecalligraphy.html+) to purchase your supplies for the I Still Love Calligraphy class. One of the fantastic parts of this hobby is that it can easily fit inside a small lunch box! 
 
Paper & Ink Arts is definitely my preferred place for calligraphy supplies, but I've found a lot of local shops have just what I need when I'm in a pinch. You won't find what you need at craft and hobby stores. Hobby Lobby has some inks, but Michael's and JoAnn have nothing. Not much that I would recommend, at least. Hit up art supply stores, university bookstores, vintage stores or specialty stationery shops. 

Let’s break down the materials and why I recommend them.

## CONTAINER

One of my favorite things about the hobby/practice of calligraphy is that it takes up very little space. I have a rolling flat storage unit ([Ikea's ALEX](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50167158/#/40196241)), but when I have to take my work on the road it all fits snugly in a small shoe box. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-3-pencil.jpg }}"/>

## PENCIL + ERASER

You’ll definitely need a pencil. Any kind of pencil will work, though I do love [drafting lead holders](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+leadho.html+). You have to purchase leads separately for these kinds of pencils, but you can find a range of soft to hard leads 6H – 6B and everything in between. I personally prefer B and softer leads for my practice work. 

You’ll need a non-marking eraser for drafting your projects (especially when you first start out). I can’t recommend the [Pentel click eraser](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+clic.html+) enough. It cleanly removes pencil markings and the eraser rubber lasts forever. If you have large fields of pencil to erase, a large vinyl eraser works well.

A simple mechanical pencil will do just fine for the purposes of our class, but if you’re like me and get excited about new writing instruments, you’ll like these.

## INK

I’ve not tried every single brand of ink out there, but of the brands that I have tried, here are my thoughts on them: 

**FW Acrylic Ink** is basically like thinned out paint. This works remarkably well on dark and rough surfaces. Since it’s like a loose paint, the bottles need to be shaken before use for even consistency. This ink works best with nibs with larger vents. The thickness of the ink doesn’t lend itself towards fine hairlines. It’s great for larger scale letters. 

**Koh-I-Noor India Ink** is an india ink with a loose consistency. It’s perfect for fine points. It dries quickly with a satin charcoal sheen. It’s great for scan and photo work as the hairlines are pronounced even with the finest points. The loose ink works well on most papers, but not Kraft paper (from my experience). 

**Speedball India Ink** should not be confused for Speedball Acrylic ink. The acrylic ink is too gloopy. I’m not a fan. The India ink, however, is a great loose ink for practice and final work. It dries quickly with a completely flat finish with slightly raised texture. Great for both large and small nibs. It has a very readable hairline for photo and scan work. 

**Sumi 60 Ink** is deliciously smooth. It’s a completely opaque ink with the perfect consistency for very delicate hairlines. It doesn’t bleed on loose-weave papers, but it dries with a slight sheen making it difficult for scanning. It has a longer drying time than most inks, so you want to wait at least an hour before touching. It’s the best truly waterproof ink, perfect for mixed media work. 

**Pelikan Brilliant Black** are ideal for fountain pens, but work fabulously for the dip pens. Like Sumi ink, it has super fine hairlines and is completely opaque, but it dries much quicker with a completely flat appearance. Perfect for scanning. 

**Higgins Eternal** is quite thin. Apparently it used to have a more viscous consistency about 15-20 years ago. It’s still the most common practice ink among calligraphers. It’s also most common in art supply stores and one of the most inexpensive inks available. It works well on the Rhodia pad and has nice thin consistency. It’s hit or miss on other papers, though. 

**Iron Gall ink** is a highly corrosive ink that dates back to 70 A.D. The ink is thin and semi-opaque with a bluish black tint to it, but over time turns more opaque and warm. It can be handmade ([recipe](http://irongallink.org/igi_index78f9.html)), but because of its acidic nature, the nib should be cleaned thoroughly during and after use. This is my go-to ink when working with less-than-ideal paper. It doesn’t bleed or feather. It gives very fine hairlines, but not ideal for scanning or photo work.

**McCaffrey’s Penman’s ink** has a very similar feel and composition to the Iron Gall ink and get’s more opaque with time. Very corrosive to nibs if proper care isn’t taken. It’s even lighter than Iron Gall ink. You get very delicate hairlines, perfect for whimsical and romantic work. Over time mold spores may grow (as it is made from organic material) making it mold. It doesn’t go bad, simply pick out the skin and continue use. 

**Walnut Ink** is a very common calligraphy ink used by master penmen and women. It’s a handmade ink that’s lightfast and sepia colored. It can come in liquid or powder form so you can dilute and thicken as you see fit. It’s semi-opaque with very fine hairlines. Dries quickly.

**Windsor & Newton** is similar to FW with its thick consistency, but needs to be stirred more frequently. The black is the best of all the colors offered. 

Windsor & Newton and FW both come in pearlescent colors. Be wary that most of these pearlescents are very thick and can be unruly at times. You may need to water some down or use a larger nib. These shouldn’t be used as you first start out. 

**Pebeo Encre de Chine** is just a delicious ink. Not that I’ve eaten it, but it’s smooth like butter. And I LOVE butter. It’s about the same consistency as the Sumi ink, but has a satin shine. Not ideal for scans or slippery materials, but it leaves a shiny embossed texture on the paper. 

**Ziller Ink** is a smooth paint-like ink that can be pretty thick. It works well on alternate surfaces and dries relatively quickly considering the thickness and type of ink. 

Cool side note: Rich and Vivian (of Ziller Inks) tested their ink to see how well it did in freezing conditions, for those ordering inks online during the winter. These inks did very well with no discernible difference between the quality of ink before or after freezing.

**Manuscript Ink** is a fountain pen ink that comes in the most gorgeous bright blue. It’s stunning when it dries! The thin, semi-opaque ink is easy to work with and dries quickly.

**Private Reserve Ink** has a similar consistency and opacity to Higgins Eternal, but with much better quality. It can feather on some loose-weave papers, but it’s very smooth. Drying times can be slow. 

**Dr. PH Martin's** India ink is semi-transparent and lovely for creating ombre effects. It's a waterproof ink that can gum up your nib if you're not careful to clean your nib during each break. The waterproof nature is ideal for mixed media art projects, though. 

**Dr. PH Martin's pen white is a must buy!** Best white I've used. It's very thick, so shake thoroughly before using. Add a few drops of water if it's still too thick. Doesn't mix well with other brands or colors. 





The price difference between the cheap stuff and the nice stuff is negligible. Get the best ink for the job. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-2-inkaccessories.jpg }}"/> 

Sometimes inks and nibs give you trouble. You may want to consider investing in these accessories to help. 

**Gum Arabic** can be a great medium for fixing ink consistency. It can delay drying times and improve consistency. It can mold and yellow with time, so using it on archival projects may not be a great idea. 

**Gouache** is an opaque water-based paint ideal for mixing up just the right pigment for the job. Mix with water and a junk brush until you get a smooth milk-like consistency. Apply the pigment to the underside of the nib with a small brush. See the video for the full how-to.

**Ink wells and containers** are ideal for inking up your oblique pen or seeing how much ink you have on your nib. [Glass dappen](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+daplid.html+) dishes are traditional for ink mixing, but the lids don’t seal. If you plan on traveling with your ink or you have curious children, you'll want something you can close. [Small glass vials](http://www.specialtybottle.com/58dramclearshortieglassvialwblkcap.aspx) are perfect.  

The jars above are wider than small vials, so I find I'm constantly tipping the jars to get enough ink on my nib. I use a piece of sticky tack to keep the jar tilted at the perfect angle. I snatched this idea from fellow calligrapher, [Fozzy](http://thefozzybook.com/). 

## PEN NIB

The pen nib is probably the scariest thing about all of your new supplies. What the heck is this? Let’s go over the anatomy to get you better acquainted.

# Anatomy of a Pen Nib
<img src="{{ 2-supplies-3-anatomy-nib.png }}"/> 

- Tip/point: the small point allows for hairline strokes
- Slit: it allows the ink to flow down towards the point
- Tines: they separate based on pressure, creating the iconic thicks and thins
- Shoulder: where the pen transitions from the shank to the tip
- Vent: this allows the ink to flow evenly downward towards the point
- Shank: It serves two purposes, to hold the nib in the pen and to house the ink. 
- Tail/base: this is what goes into the nib holder. When purchasing new nibs/holders, make sure that they’re compatible with one another. Some nib holders are made for bigger/smaller nibs. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-4-nibsataglance.jpg }}"/>

I recommend that you purchase a few nibs as you start out. Pictured above are a few of my favorite nibs ranging from the super fine to the bold and sturdy. Each nib has a vastly different personality that yields different results. 

You basically need to “date” your nibs to see if your personalities blend well together. I definitely have my favorites, but I switch out depending on the style I’m after or what surface I’m writing on. You’ll want to head over to your local art supply store or Paper & Ink Arts to explore your options. Since each nib is typically under $2, it’s nice to purchase a large assortment when starting out.

Here’s the breakdown of recommended nibs and their strengths: 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-5-huntnibs.jpg }}"/>

Hunt nibs are among the most common around and a great brand to start with.

- **Hunt 22** – fine hairline with medium-bold drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands.

- **Hunt 56** – medium hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands and for rough surfaces. Best with thicker inks.

- **Hunt 101** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Great for heavy hands. I find this my go-to for Spencerian styling.

-  **Hunt 100** – superfine hairline with medium drama from the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. These nibs are fun, but expire quickly. 

- **Hunt 103** – superfine hairline with medium-bld drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Retains enough ink for about 1-2 letters. 

- **Hunt 108** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Requires a crowquill holder. Fun for flourishwork. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-6-esterbrooknibs.jpg }}"/>

Esterbrook is not quite as common, but they're a lot of fun to mess around with. All ideal on a smaller scale.

- **Esterbrook 355** – fine hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands. This holds more ink than the Hunt 101 or 103, I tend to use this for writing out long thank you letters.

- **Esterbrook 354** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Holds more ink than other small nibs, but still gives a lot of detail on a small scale.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-7-gillotnibs.jpg }}"/>

If you go to an art store with any selection of calligraphy supplies, you'll find these nibs. Gillott, much like Hunt, offers a lot of variety within their line of nibs.

- **Gillott 1068a** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, unpredictable surfaces and large scales. The nib is very rigid, perfect for print work (i.e. addressing envelopes).

- **Gillott 303** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Not ideal for rough surfaces.

- **Gillott 404** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. It's ideal for thick inks and heavy hands.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-8-brausenibs.jpg }}"/>

Most Brause nibs are for broad pen calligraphy like Italic and Gothic, but they have a few pointed pens that I love. These are my current go-to nibs for just about any  project.

- **Brause ef66** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy and light hands, larger scales, rough surfaces and runnier ink. 

- **Brause 511** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Great with runnier inks and hairline flourishes.

- **Brause 513** – fine hairline with light-medium drama on the downstrokes. Great for light hands, heavy hands, large and small scales. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-9-hirozebragnibs.jpg }}"/>

These two brands are a little bit harder to find, but they're equally fun to test out. They're not in tight rotation, but they're still great.

- **Hiro 40** – medium hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, huge scales, thick ink and rough surfaces.

- **Zebra G** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. This is a favorite among a lot of calligraphers, but it's not my go-to. It's got some flexibility and a lot of durability, perfect for heavy hands or beginners. Great with large scale pieces. 

If you have access to antique shops or estate sales, try looking for vintage nibs! Often times you can find a grab bag of nibs for very little and they're so fun to experiment with. 

You’ll want to be sure to protect your nibs and store them in a small, protective container. Baby food jars, Altoid tins and tic tac boxes are all great options for housing your nibs.

## NIB HOLDER

There are various types of holders: large plastic, large wood, oblique and small plastic. 

Small plastic holders (far left) are easy to find. Because of their scale, It’s a different feel than regular pens, and forces your brain to approach the pen differently. One of the biggest hurtles in learning calligraphy is how to draw with the pointed pen. If you're struggling with changing your mindset from writing to drawing, I would recommend this holder. It works with Brause, Esterbrook and the small hunt nibs. The crowquill holder looks similar, but doesn't have a ball in the center of the holder. The crowquill holder can be fun to use, but most crowquill nibs are more advanced with fine points and flexible tines which can make smooth upstrokes difficult.

You can find simple straight and ergonomic holders with a shellacked wood and metal teeth in the middle. They're great, accommodate every nib (besides crowquill) but are more of an investment. If you're a messy calligrapher, you'll find the wood cracks and chips with abuse.

The speedball straight holder is a great, cheap holder that accommodates just about every nib. If the nib is too loose, I wrap the base of the nib with a small piece of tape then insert. These holders are all plastic, clean easily and don't crack or chip.

Straight holders are ideal for upright angles and oblique holders are best suited for traditional or more dramatic calligraphy angles. I use both styles and holders interchangeably, though. The speedball holder (left) is inexpensive and suitable for both left and right-handed calligraphers. You can find some really neat handmade oblique holders at [John Neal Bookseller](http://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/133), [Unique Obliques](http://www.etsy.com/shop/UniqueObliques) and [Yoke Pen Company](http://www.yokepencompany.com). The far right holder was inherited from my great-great grandfather. I love having it with me, but it's not comfortable to use. Finding a holder that fits comfortably in your hand is very important.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-11-nibplacement.jpg }}"/>

Placing your nib in the holder can be tricky especially if it’s a straight holder with metal teeth or an oblique holder.

For fitting the nib in a straight holder, place your nibs along the outside of the metal teeth. You can adjust the teeth outward for a tighter or looser fit, depending upon your nib size.

![/1-oblique-pen-positioning.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/calligraphy/client/1-oblique-pen-positioning.jpg)

For fitting the nib in an oblique holder, you want to place the holder on the table with the flange pointing away from you and on the left-hand side of the pen’s staff. Insert the nib facing inward slightly. If you’re a lefty, you’ll want to have pen resting on the table with the flange pointing away from you and to the right-hand side of the pen’s staff. Insert facing inward just slightly. See above for the breakdown.

If you have a brass flange, you can bend the flange by hand in towards the main body of the holder. Be careful to avoid bending it too far. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-14-cleaners.jpg }}"/>

## CLEANER

Traditionally you can use ink cleaner, which is a mixture of glycerin and some kind of cleaner. You can find that at your local art supply store. Fact is, it lasts forever but it’s terribly messy. Heaven forbid that your local toddler gets into it and spills its dark, inky contents everywhere! 

I have a small jar of water and a quarter sheet of [Yoke pen wipes](http://www.yokepencompany.com/collections/accessories/products/yoke-pen-company-nib-pen-wipe-sample-pack). I’ll dip my nib into the water and wipe the inky contents off on the lint-free wipe. If I don’t have one of those on-hand, I’ll use water and a paper towel or clorox wipes or baby wipes. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-13-paper.jpg }}"/>

## PAPER

You can’t always pick the kind of paper that you work on, especially if you’re doing projects like addressing envelopes. Here are some of my favorite ink-friendly papers:

- Rhodia Pad (pictured left) - available gridded and plain
- Vintage Wallpaper, although not archival
- Scrapbooking Paper
- 100% cotton rag Paper (Moab, Strathmore, Mohawk)
- Watercolor Paper (great for a rugged texture)
- Metallic Paper
- Paper specifically for laser printing

Rule of thumb: if it’s high quality or coated, you’ll be happy with the results. And stay away from "Calligraphy" pads from the art supply store. That paper is better suited for other types of calligraphy. You'll find your nib will skip with nearly each upstroke.

## ENVIRONMENT

Having the correct environment is more important than you might think. Here are some things you’ll want to think about as you set up your space:

- Lots of elbowroom
- A large scrap paper underneath work
- Cleaner and paper towels at the ready
- Minimal distractions
- Computer for spell checking (if needed)
- No carpet, if at all possible (my studio’s carpet is completely stained)
- Wear an apron
- Roll up sleeves
- Pull back hair
- Plenty of good lighting
- Kids at bay

I try to run through this list as I work on any calligraphy project. I’ve been lettering for some time and know how frustrating it is to completely ruin a project because of a little distraction.  The stakes tend to grow quickly as a piece develops, and that’s when a toddler/husband/cat will sneak up behind you and bump your elbow.

## ADDITIONAL TIPS

Advice given from recent student Karina Lim, about ordering supplies if you're in the Indonesia/Singapore/Malaysia areas: 

*THE ESSENTIALS*

Such as holders nibs, dedicated inks ordering online from the standards such as paper ink arts is best for range and price (by far, even with dreaded shipping) and staff helpfulness. Even if your local art shop carries any supplies, they are likely clueless about anything copperplate and will only give you misinformation or be unable to help you with your questions.

*THE EXTRAS*

For stationery & storage, nib organizers: try the following chain book/ lifestyle stores: 'Popular', Kinokuniya (pens), Daiso, Japan Home, Muji. You know my nib storage box is a nail art organizer box from Daiso.

Art Friend's good for brushes, paints, palettes, watercolor paper etc... But not copperplate calligraphy supplies. Overjoyed seems to be the only place in Singapore that stocks Rhodia pads. 

I still haven't found the ideal source of color mixing containers/ ink dipping containers... its kinda makeshift right now. 

Malaysia has a lot of the same chain stores. 

And Indonesians are always traveling into Singapore to shop/ holiday/ work... so if they had too, they could get supplies here. I think online shopping and shipping isn't so straightforward for them... don't know if it's gotten better. 

I hope that was helpful from a student's perspective!
