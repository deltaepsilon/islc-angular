### In this lesson, you’ll learn the whats and whys of outfitting yourself with the correct tools and the perfect lettering environment.

You should have your supplies in front of you. If not, head over to [Paper and Ink Arts](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+index.html+) to purchase your supplies for the I Still Love Calligraphy class (under the conferences and classes link). One of the fantastic parts of this hobby is that it can easily fit inside a small lunch box and it costs as little as $30 to get completely outfitted!

Paper & Ink Arts is definitely my preferred place for calligraphy supplies, but I've found a lot of local shops have just what I need when I'm in a pinch. You won't find what you need at craft and hobby stores. Hobby Lobby has some inks, but Michael's and JoAnn have nothing. Nothing that I would recommend, at least. Hit up art supply stores, university bookstores or specialty stationery shops.

Let’s break down the materials and why I recommend them.

## CONTAINER

One of my favorite things about the hobby/practice of calligraphy is that it takes up very little space. I have a rolling flat storage unit (Ikea's ALEX), but when I have to take my work on the road it all fits snugly in a small shoe box.

## PENCIL + ERASER

You’ll definitely need a pencil. Any old #2 will work, though I do love drafting lead holders. You can purchase the range of soft to hard leads 6H – 6B and everything in between.

You’ll need a non-marking eraser for drafting your projects (especially when you first start out). I can’t recommend the Pentel white click eraser enough. It cleanly removes pencil markings and the eraser rubber lasts forever.

## INK

I’ve not tried every single brand of ink out there, but of the brands that I have tried; FW, Windsor & Newton, Sumi and DR. PH Martin's are top on my list.

**FW** is an acrylic ink, it's basically like thinned out paint. This works remarkably well on dark and rough surfaces.

**Windsor & Newton** is similar to FW with its thick consistency, but needs to be stirred more frequently. The black is the best of all the colors offered.

**Sumi** is hands down my favorite. It's the most expensive of the inks above, but lasts forever. The mouth of the jar is wide enough for dipping the oblique pen and it glides over any surface smoothly. This particular ink leaves a shiny raised texture, not ideal for scanning.

**Speedry** is semi-transparent but runny. You can find it in a wide variety of colors, but it's not as flexible with media like FW and Sumi.

**Dr. PH Martin's** India ink is semi-transparent and lovely for creating ombre effects. It's a waterproof ink that can gum up your nib if you're not careful to clean your nib during each break. The waterproof nature is ideal for mixed media art projects, though. **Dr. PH Martin's pen white is a must buy!** Best white I've used. It's very thick, so shake thoroughly before using. Add a few drops of water if it's too thick. Doesn't mix well with other brands.

Stay far, far away from Higgin's inks. Color isn't vibrant and the thin ink tends to bleed and feather on just about every medium.

The price difference between the cheap stuff and the nice stuff is negligible. Get the nice ink from the get-go.

Sometimes inks and nibs give you trouble. You may want to consider investing in these accessories to help.

**Gum Arabic** is a great medium for regulating ink consistency. If the ink is bleeding or it's just too thick, add a few drops and mix right in.

**Gouache** is an opaque water-based paint ideal for mixing up just the right pigment for the job. Mix with water and gum arabic with a junk brush until you get a smooth cream-like consistency.

**Ink wells and containers** are ideal for inking up your oblique pen. Glass dappen dishes are traditional for ink mixing, but don't seal. If you plan on traveling with your ink or you have curious children, you'll want something you can close. [Small glass vials](http://www.specialtybottle.com/58dramclearshortieglassvialwblkcap.aspx) are perfect.

The jars above are wider than small viles, so I find I'm constantly tipping the jars to get enough ink on my nib. I use a piece of polymer clay to keep the jar at the perfect angle. I snatched this idea from fellow calligrapher, [Fozzy](http://thefozzybook.com/).

## PEN NIB

The pen nib is probably the scariest thing about all of your new supplies. What the heck is this? Let’s go over the anatomy to get you better acquainted.

# anatomy of a pen nib
<img src="{{ 2-supplies-3-anatomy-nib.png }}"/>

- Tip/point: the small point allows for hairline strokes
- Slit: it allows the ink to flow down towards the point
- Tines: they separate based on pressure, creating the iconic thicks and thins
- Shoulder: where the pen transitions from the shank to the tip
- Vent: this allows the ink to flow evenly downward towards the point
- Shank: It serves two purposes, to hold the nib in the pen and to house the ink.
- Tail/base: this is what goes into the nib holder. When purchasing new nibs/holders, make sure that they’re compatible with one another. Some nib holders are made for bigger/smaller nibs.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-4-nibsataglance.jpg }}"/>

I recommend that you purchase a few nibs as you start out. Pictured above are a few of my favorite nibs ranging from the super fine to the bold and sturdy. Each nib has a vastly different personality that yields different results.

You basically need to “date” your nibs to see if your personalities blend well together. I definitely have my favorites, but I switch out depending on the style I’m after. You’ll want to head over to your local art supply store or Paper & Ink Arts to explore your options. Since each nib is typically under $2, it’s nice to purchase an assortment.

Here’s the breakdown of recommended nibs and their strengths:

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-5-huntnibs.jpg }}"/>

Hunt nibs are among the most common around and a great brand to start with.

- **Hunt 22** – fine hairline with medium-bold drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands.
- **Hunt 56** – medium hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands and for rough surfaces. Best with thicker inks.
- **Hunt 101** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Great for heavy hands. I find this my go-to for Spencerian styling.
-  **Hunt 100** – superfine hairline with medium drama from the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. These nibs are fun, but expire quickly.
- **Hunt 103** – superfine hairline with medium-bld drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Retains enough ink for about 1-2 letters.
- **Hunt 108** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Requires a crowquill holder. Fun for flourishwork.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-6-esterbrooknibs.jpg }}"/>

Esterbrook is not quite as common, but they're a lot of fun to mess around with. All ideal on a smaller scale.

- **Esterbrook 355** – fine hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands. This holds more ink than the Hunt 101 or 103, I tend to use this for writing out long thank you letters.
- **Esterbrook 354** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Holds more ink than other small nibs, but still gives a lot of detail on a small scale.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-7-gillotnibs.jpg }}"/>

If you go to an art store with any selection of calligraphy supplies, you'll find these nibs. Gillot, much like Hunt, offers a lot of variety within their line of nibs.

- **Gillot 1068a** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, unpredictable surfaces and large scales. The nib is very rigid, perfect for print work (i.e. addressing envelopes).
- **Gillot 303** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Not recommended for rough surfaces.
- **Gillot 404** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. It's ideal for thick inks and heavy hands.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-8-brausenibs.jpg }}"/>

Most Brause nibs are for broad pen calligraphy like Italic and Gothic, but they have a few pointed pens that I love. These are my current go-to nibs for just about any  project.

- **Brause ef66** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy and light hands, larger scales, rough surfaces and runnier ink.
- **Brause 511** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Great with runnier inks and hairline flourishes.
- **Brause 513** – fine hairline with light-medium drama on the downstrokes. Great for light hands, heavy hands, large and small scales.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-9-hirozebragnibs.jpg }}"/>

These two brands are a little bit harder to find, but they're equally fun to test out. They're not in tight rotation, but they're still great.

- **Hiro 40** – medium hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, huge scales, thick ink and rough surfaces.
- **Zebra G** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. This is a favorite among a lot of calligraphers, but it's not my go-to. It's got a lot of flexibility and durability, perfect for heavy hands. Great with large scale pieces.

You’ll want to be sure to protect your nibs and store them in a small, protective container. Baby food jars, Altoid tins and tic tac boxes are all great options for housing your nibs.

## NIB HOLDER

There are various types of holders: large plastic, large wood, oblique and small plastic.

Small plastic holders (far left) are easy to find. Because of their scale, It’s a different feel than regular pens, and forces your brain to approach the pen differently. One of the biggest hurtles in learning calligraphy is how to draw with the pointed pen. If you're struggling with changing your mindset from writing to drawing, I would recommend this holder. It works with Brause, Esterbrook and the small hunt nibs. The crowquill holder looks similar, but doesn't have a ball in the center of the holder.

You can find simple straight and ergonomic holders with a shellacked wood and metal teeth in the middle. They're great, accommodate every nib (besides crowquill) but are more of an investment. If you're a messy calligrapher, you'll find the wood cracks and chips with abuse.

The speedball straight holder is a great, cheap holder that accommodates just about every nib. If the nib is too loose, I wrap the base of the nib with a small piece of tape then insert. These holders are all plastic, clean easily and don't crack or chip.

Straight holders are ideal for upright angles and oblique holders are best suited for traditional or more dramatic calligraphy angles. I use both styles and holders interchangeably, though. The speedball holder (left) is inexpensive and suitable for both left and right-handed calligraphers. You can find some really neat handmade oblique holders at [John Neal Bookseller](http://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/133). The far right holder was inherited from my great-great grandfather. I love it, but I never use it.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-11-nibplacement.jpg }}"/>

Placing your nib in your holder is pretty straight forward, save for the holders with teeth. Place your nibs along the outside of the metal teeth. You can adjust them for a tighter or looser fit, depending upon your nib size.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-14-cleaners.jpg }}"/>

## CLEANER

Traditional calligraphers use ink cleaner, which is a mixture of glicerine and dishsoap. You can find that at your local art supply store. Fact is, it lasts forever but it’s terribly messy. Heaven forbid that your local toddler gets into it and spills its dark, inky contents everywhere! Alternatively, I use Clorox or baby wet wipes. They’re fantastic for cleaning nibs, wiping up mistakes (if using a coated paper) and they’re easily contained. It’s also likely that you already have them on hand.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-13-paper.jpg }}"/>

## PAPER

You can’t always pick the kind of paper that you work on, especially if you’re doing projects like addressing envelopes. Here are some of my favorite ink-friendly papers:

- Rhodia Pad (pictured left) - available gridded and plain
- Vintage Wallpaper, although not archival
- Scrapbooking Paper
- 100% cotton rag Paper (Moab, Strathmore, Mohawk)
- Watercolor Paper (great for a rugged texture)
- Metallic Paper
- Paper specifically for laser printing

Rule of thumb: if it’s high quality or coated, you’ll be happy with the results. And stay away from "Calligraphy" pads from the art supply store. That paper is better suited for broad-tipped calligraphy. You'll find your nib will skip with nearly each upstroke.

## ENVIRONMENT

Having the correct environment is more important than you might think. Here are some things you’ll want to think about as you set up your project space:

- Lots of elbowroom
- No table legs in your way
- A large scrap paper underneath your work
- Cleaner and paper towels at the ready
- Peace and quiet (light music?)
- Computer for spell checking (if needed)
- NO CARPET anywhere nearby if at all possible
- Wear an apron
- Roll up your sleeves
- Pull back your hair
- Plenty of good lighting
- Kids at bay

I try to run through this list as I work on any calligraphy project. I’ve been lettering for some time and know how frustrating it is to completely ruin a project because of a little distraction.  The stakes tend to grow quickly as a piece develops, and that’s when a toddler/husband/cat will sneak up behind you and bump your elbow.
