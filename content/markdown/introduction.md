## MY HISTORY

Hello there! It’s Melissa Esplin, of I Still Love You and I’m so excited to share with you my love for calligraphy. This e-course is a long time coming and I’m just thrilled that it’s finally here.

My love for lettering and calligraphy goes way, way back; back to the beginning. I’ve never been much for writing, but I love to draw letters. I had the best handwriting in my classes in grade school. I was so eager to learn cursive as a beginning second-grader that I would sneak into the third grade classroom after school and copy down the cursive letters before heading home for the day. I’ve always felt like cursive letterforms are oh so graceful.

Fast forward to 7th grade where I finally took my first art class. We learned about Old English lettering. I immediately found it fascinating, stole my brother’s calligraphy set and wrote out as many words as I could. Typically it was just my name.

Junior high was when the scrapbooking scene hit my house full force. My mom started making layouts and cards and I would make cards along side her. I was never super satisfied with the folksy stamps, so I started hand lettering and illustrating my cards. This was when my dad bought me a copyright and I started making card sets for other people. My little ‘business’ didn’t go anywhere, but I sure did think I was cool.

In junior high and high school I got incredibly involved in the art-making scene. In addition to my growing love for the fine arts, I was constantly hand-lettering posters and flyers for friends, school and church events.

As I embarked on my first year of college, I started work at a graphic design firm on campus as an office secretary. It was then that I learned how to actually turn on a computer (how was that in 2003?), send attachments and eventually teach myself the ins and outs of Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. I made the transition to graphic designer within the office and quickly became immersed in the digital world. I completely forgot about my hand lettering.

It wasn’t until 2009, when my friend Jenn posted a gorgeous printable card with her hand lettering that I even thought about how much I loved hand lettering. I saw her gorgeous handwriting and something clicked. I knew I needed to get back to my analog lettering and incorporate that into my design work. How had I let this lay dormant for so long?

## CALLIGRAPHY HISTORY

You have all had exposure to calligraphy in its various forms. Now, if you’re like me, trying to look up videos and books to increase your knowledge on calligraphy. You’ll realize that by just searching “Calligraphy”, you don’t come up with the results that you’re after.

Probably the most common forms of calligraphy include Old English Calligraphy (a lettering style achieved by an angled pen nib) and Chinese Calligraphy (brush lettering in the Chinese language). Now these different styles are really fun to sink your teeth into, but these styles don’t lend themselves to modern interpretation as much as Copperplate Calligraphy does. Copperplate is written with a pointed nib like the calligraphy pens you’ll find at the art store.

“Copperplate” is the umbrella term for using both pointed pen and pressure to create the dramatic thicks and thins that are so iconic in calligraphy. Within the pointed-pen calligraphy umbrella, you have 3 popular styles: Copperplate, Spencerian and Roundhand.

The Copperplate style was birthed sometime in the 16th century as printers used pointed pens to etch letters into copper plates for mass production of books. Spencerian, Roundhand and even our modern cursive alphabet are modern offshoots of the original Copperplate style.

## GETTING STARTED

I’m excited to help you learn more about traditional copperplate calligraphy as you develop your own personal style. The objectives within this course are:

1. Learn and become comfortable with the pointed pen
2. Learn the basics of Copperplate Calligraphy
3. Learn the basic anatomy of the letterforms
4. Apply your knowledge of the above to create your own unique lettering
5. Encourage creativity within your new hobby

This course is not your grandma’s calligraphy class. I take a more post-modern approach to the traditional techniques and practices within calligraphy.

In art school, one of the biggest things we talked about was how, living in a post-modern era, everything has been done before. As a starry-eyed freshman, there was nothing more depressing than hearing those words come from my professors. As I’ve matured and ventured into the online world, I’ve come to realize that while everything has been done before, no two people are the same. By leveraging the traditional practices of art and calligraphy and inserting your own unique perspective, you will make something that is entirely individual to you. And that is where the true art of lettering lies—in your own personality.

Let’s get going!
