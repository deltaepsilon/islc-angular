### In this lesson, you’ll learn basic techniques on how to properly hold the pen and how much ink to use.

One of the biggest hurtles of learning calligraphy is learning how to use the pointed pen. For some, this comes naturally; for others there’s nothing more frustrating. Of the students that I’ve taught over the years, the ones who pick up the lettering fastest are the ones that recognize the difference between writing with a ballpoint pen and drawing with a pointed pen.

## HOLDING THE PEN

Think back to when you were learning to print your name in primary school. My teachers emphasized holding the pencil correctly. This technique is the same in calligraphy. Pick the pen up near the nib with your index and thumb. Allow the top of the pen to rest on the knuckle of your index finger. The bottom of the pen will rest on the bone between the tip and the joint of your middle finger. You should be holding your pen at about a 40º angle from the paper.

DO NOT hold the pen in a vice grip (see above for what NOT to do). It’s nearly impossible to achieve the correct angle to allow the tines to separate on the downstrokes and to avoid skipping on the upstrokes.

## ANGLE OF THE NIB

You want to make sure that the shoulders of the nib are always pointing downward, the shank’s curvature is pointing upwards.

The direction of your pen should point parallel to your downstroke. When using the straight holder you will be more naturally inclined to write at a more upright angle. To change to a more dramatic angle comfortably, rotate your paper more dramatically counter-clockwise or switch to an oblique holder.

## PRESSURE

You’ll be so surprised at how little you have to press on the paper in order to make a mark. Gravity is working with you, so all you have to do to make a hairline stroke is to touch the fibers of the paper (just a little) and move your pen. As long as you have enough ink on your nib, you should barely be grazing the paper as you make your upstrokes.

Clearly you want to press harder as you make your down strokes. You want to leave the tines behind as you press and drag. This will allow the ink to spread between the two lines and make the wide marks. You’ll be surprised at how much abuse your pen can take, but be warned, you want to keep your pen at the 40º angle when doing the down strokes. If your pen is too upright as you make your wide strokes, your tines will bend permanently.

## INK


When inking up your nib, you want to make sure you have the right amount of ink; not too much and not too little. Dip your nib into the ink well about 1/8th of an inch past the shoulders. As you take the nib out of the well, tap the excess ink off the shoulders once or twice.


When you first start out, you’ll want to make preliminary marks on a scratch sheet of paper to see how much or little ink is on your nib. Also, if it’s the first time that you’re inking your nib, the ink will likely try to pull off the nib. This is because there’s a fine layer of oil covering your nib. Clean it off with a wet wipe or ink cleaner before you get started.


If you find your nib is not making a mark, clean off your nib with the wet wipe and dip again. Also, try scratching at the paper. The downside to using waterproof ink is that it can dry and harden at the point, creating a block in the flow. Scratch the dried ink off of the tip to restore flow.

    <h2>EXERCISE 2</h2>
    <p>
      Slide your basic strokes worksheet underneath your tracing paper. With a pencil or a paintbrush, practice the basic miniscule and majuscule forms. Refer back to the basic anatomy of the stroke in the previous lesson for your guide to press and release when making the thicks and thins of your letterforms.

    <h2>EXERCISE 3</h2>
    <p>
      Once you’ve mastered the basic strokes with your pencil or paintbrush, it’s time to move on to the pointed pen! Slide your basic strokes worksheet underneath a new sheet of tracing paper and practice each miniscule and majuscule stroke. Don’t worry about any shaking that might occur. The goal of this exercise is to get you comfortable with pressing and releasing with your pen. Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.

Practice your miniscules as many times as it takes to get familiar with the pen. If you’re having a hard time getting it right, upload your project to the assignment [gallery](/#!/gallery). I’ll help you troubleshoot.
