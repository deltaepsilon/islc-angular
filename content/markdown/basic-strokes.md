### In this lesson, you will learn the basic anatomy of a letter and identifying the basic strokes in each letter.

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, many of the letterforms mimic one another. There are basic shapes within the English alphabet that make up each letter: miniscules for lowercase letters and majuscules for uppercase letters. Mastering these strokes in muscle memory will allow you to be more consistent in your lettering and flourishes. In each calligraphy discipline (Roundhand, Spencerian, Engrosser’s script, etc) there are different basic strokes. The basic strokes below are a simplified version of those strokes according to the book of Melissa. 

Before we go into those basic shapes, let's talk about the basic anatomy of a letter: 

- **Ascender line:** the top guide line at which letters stop
- **Waistline/Header:** the middle line, where the lowercase letters hit or where strokes ‘pinch’
- **Baseline:** the bottom line where characters sit
- **Descender line:** the lowest guide line at which letters go
- **Backbone:** the spine or primary line of capital letters
- **Bowl:** the curved line
- **Counter space:** the interior space (open or closed) of a curved line
- **Loop:** the enclosed counter of a letter, usually a descender or ascender
- **Descender:** the part of a letter that descends below the baseline
- **Ascender:** the part of a letter that ascends above the waistline
- **Leg:** the bottom stroke of a letter (as seen in K, R, L, etc)
- **X-height:** the distance between the baseline and waistline
- **Slope/Angle line:** the angle at which the letters lean
- **Shade:** the widest point of the letter’s line-weight, always a downstroke
- **Hairline:** the finest point of the letter’s line-weight, always an upstroke or horizontal stroke

## MINISCULES

Each lowercase letter in the alphabet (save a few rogues) uses at least one of these shapes. These shapes are written out in the 55º angle traditionally used in Copperplate calligraphy. For ease of use, all diagrams are going to be in a 63º angle. As you practice on your gridded paper, you can recreate the same slope line by lining up the top right corner of one box and the bottom left corner of the box below it with a ruler and penciling in. Grids and slope lines are crucial for getting consistency down with the basics. Even if you plan on executing a meandering style down the road, practicing muscle memory with consistent angles and scales will help you maintain a consistent meandering style. 

- **Intro stroke:** Connects letters together. Start at the baseline and curve upward, visualizing the bottom right hand side of an oval to get that consistent curve. 

- **O stroke:** It’s the foundation and sets the tone for all the other basic strokes in the group. As you can see, the oval shape is repeated throughout the basics. Start on the right-hand side on the hairline and curve counter-clockwise. 

- **I stroke:** This strokes makes up many of the lowercase letters, but can be difficult to achieve since it starts with a thick square. You can use a square or a slightly rounded top, but the stroke is generally at full shade-width from the get-go. Before moving the pen downward, press the tines apart and pull the pen downward. Before turning the curve, release pressure to a hairline, then lightly touch the pen on the way up, making sure the stroke finishes at the waistline.

- **Wavy stroke:** It looks like an ~, and navigates the exterior space between two ovals side-by-side. Start with a hairline, slowly add pressure as you turn the curve, and start to release it at the mid-point of the x-height. Transition to a hairline just before making the curve at the baseline and finish at the waistline.

- **Ascender stroke:** This stroke makes up most ascender stroke letters (although a few don’t have a loop, like the t and d). Start at the waistline with a hairline, curving around, making the counter-space make a similar curve to the oval in the o stroke. Slowly transition to a shade and keep the pressure all the way down. Finish by releasing pressure upwards. 

- **Descender stroke:** This stroke is used for most letters with a descender (except for p, q and f). Start the stroke off similar to the i stroke with tines separated before moving downward. Maintain pressure until the curve approaches. Release pressure before the curve to a hairline. Finish out the stroke with a loop up to the waistline. 

- **Commadot:** This stroke is used in various forms for flourishing and in lowercase letters. Start just below the waistline, curving up and pressing the tines down as you curve around, making a filled circle. Finish out the stroke to the waistline in a hairline stroke.

Notice above where the thick lines transition to the thin lines. Be aware of where that starts to taper off and get ahead of it in your own practice. Most strokes start top-left and work their way down, but it’s not always the case. Making sure to transition from thick to thin early enough is key to making your basic strokes look clean and professional.

## MAJUSCULES

The uppercase characters aren’t nearly as predictable as the lowercase, but you’ll still find many of the same forms repeated throughout.

Uppercase letters of the alphabet in the Copperplate style are, in my mind, flourished versions of lowercase letters. They often have similar basic structure to the lower case letters, but with a bit more majesty. So as you look at the basic structures that compose the uppercase letters versus the basic strokes that compose flourishes, you see a considerable amount of overlap.

- **Swelled stroke:** This stroke makes up the backbone of most uppercase letters it resembles a / more than an S in curvature. Start with a hairline, swell into the full shade at the waistline, then taper back into the hairline by the base. A slight oval-inspired curve at the top and bottom are made. 

- **Lead-in Loop:** This loop is the lead-in flourish of many uppercase letters. It’s not always the case, but in the alphabet I’ve put together, you do. As you form your own style you may end up nixing this particular stroke all-together. Start at the waistline and curve up to the ascender line, curve downward with the same curvature of the oval in the o stroke, but cut in a little earlier to exit out of the loop. 

- **9 swirl:** A spiral stroke that goes against the grain. Start at the baseline and curve all the way up and to the left, meeting at the ascender line. Curve downward and swell. Cut in a little early and taper into a hairline. As you terminate the stroke, double back on the line to create a comma dot (totally optional, but fun to practice for other styles of calligraphy). 

- **Stunt Swirl:** This loop is used often in flourishing. It’s basically the same as the lead-in loop, but at a larger scale spanning form the baseline to the ascender line.

## BASIC FLOURISH STROKES

Flourishes can be broken down into 4 basic stroke styles. Once you have the shapes down committed to muscle memory, it’s not hard at all to combine.

I approach combining each basic stroke much like a choreographer would combine basic dance steps to create a ballet, but we’ll talk more about flourishes, later.
