### In this lesson, you will learn the basic anatomy of a letter and identifying the basic strokes in each letter.

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, many of the letterforms mimic one another. There are basic shapes within the English alphabet that make up each letter: miniscules for lowercase letters and majuscules for uppercase letters. Mastering these strokes in muscle memory will allow you to be more consistent in your lettering and flourishes.

## MINISCULES

Each lowercase letter in the alphabet (save a few rogues) uses at least one of these shapes. These shapes are written out in the 55º angle traditionally used in Copperplate calligraphy.

Notice above where the thick lines transition to the thin lines. Be aware of where that starts to taper off and get ahead of it in your own practice. With each of the miniscule strokes, you always start at the top and work your way down.

## MAJUSCULES

The uppercase characters aren’t nearly as predictable as the lowercase, but you’ll still find many of the same forms repeated throughout.

Uppercase letters of the alphabet in the Copperplate style are, in my mind, flourished versions of lowercase letters. They often have similar basic structure to the lower case letters, but with a bit more majesty. So as you look at the basic structures that compose the uppercase letters versus the basic strokes that compose flourishes, you see a considerable amount of overlap.

## BASIC FLOURISH STROKES

Flourishes can be broken down into 3 basic shapes. Once you have the shapes down commited to muscle memory, it’s not hard at all to combine.

I approach combining each basic stroke much like a choreographer would combine basic dance steps to create a ballet. We’ll talk more about flourishes, later.
