### In this lesson, you will learn the importance of spacing the letters evenly.

Once you feel comfortable with your letterforms, making the jump to writing out words and sentences is only natural. As you add letters to form words, try to visualize one or two letters ahead.  Try to see where your pen needs to go to link the letters. This will help you to avoid mistakes. 


As you continue to each letter of a word, you’ll recognize a certain flow occurs. Be mindful of that flow and keep it consistent. This is called kerning. Keeping your letter-spacing consistent will work wonders to your lettering as you figure out your own personal style.

Changing up your kerning for different projects will vastly change the way your lettering feels and reads.

Helpful tips in keeping kerning consistent:


Keep the same speed as you write out each letter. My mantra (thanks Phil from Modern Family) is Slow is Smooth and Smooth is Fast. Work slowly through each letter and you’ll find that mistakes happen a lot less frequently.


As you start a project, you’ll want to pencil out your letters very lightly. From here you can fix the letter-spacing to keep the project consistent. When you finalize it with the pointed pen, you’ll find yourself stressing less and focusing more on perfecting the thick and thin strokes.

      Write out the word “hello” several times while paying attention to the pattern of how the letters connect. Once you feel comfortable, write out a word or phrase. The phrase, “The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog” uses all of the letters in the alphabet. It will help you practice each letter and how to connect them together.
