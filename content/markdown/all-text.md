## MY HISTORY 

Hello there! It’s Melissa Esplin, of I Still Love You and I’m so excited to share with you my love for calligraphy. This e-course is a long time coming and I’m just thrilled that it’s finally here.

<img src="{{ 1-introduction-1.jpeg }}"/>
 
My love for lettering and calligraphy goes way, way back; back to the beginning. I’ve never been much for writing, but I love to draw letters. I had the best handwriting in my classes in grade school. I was so eager to learn cursive as a beginning second-grader that I would sneak into the third grade classroom after school and copy down the cursive letters before heading home for the day. I’ve always felt like cursive letterforms are oh so graceful.  

Fast forward to 7th grade where I finally took my first art class. We learned about Old English lettering. I immediately found it fascinating, stole my brother’s calligraphy set and wrote out as many words as I could. Typically it was just my name. 

Junior high was when the scrapbooking scene hit my house full force. My mom started making layouts and cards and I would make cards along side her. I was never super satisfied with the folksy stamps, so I started hand lettering and illustrating my cards. This was when my dad bought me a copyright and I started making card sets for other people. My little ‘business’ didn’t go anywhere, but I sure did think I was cool. 

<img src="{{ 1-introduction-2.jpeg }}"/> 

In junior high and high school I got incredibly involved in the art-making scene. In addition to my growing love for the fine arts, I was constantly hand-lettering posters and flyers for friends, school and church events. 

As I embarked on my first year of college, I started work at a graphic design firm on campus as an office secretary. It was then that I learned how to actually turn on a computer (how was that in 2003?), send attachments and eventually teach myself the ins and outs of Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. I made the transition to graphic designer within the office and quickly became immersed in the digital world. I completely forgot about my hand lettering. 

It wasn’t until 2009, when my friend Jenn posted a gorgeous printable card with her hand lettering that I even thought about how much I loved hand lettering. I saw her gorgeous handwriting and something clicked. I knew I needed to get back to my analog lettering and incorporate that into my design work. How had I let this lay dormant for so long?

## CALLIGRAPHY HISTORY

You have all had exposure to calligraphy in its various forms. Now, if you’re like me, trying to look up videos and books to increase your knowledge on calligraphy. You’ll realize that by just searching “Calligraphy”, you don’t come up with the results that you’re after. 

Probably the most common forms of calligraphy include Old English Calligraphy (a lettering style achieved by an angled pen nib) and Chinese Calligraphy (brush lettering in the Chinese language). Now these different styles are really fun to sink your teeth into, but these styles don’t lend themselves to modern interpretation as much as Copperplate Calligraphy does. Copperplate is written with a pointed nib like the calligraphy pens you’ll find at the art store.

“Copperplate” is the umbrella term for using both pointed pen and pressure to create the dramatic thicks and thins that are so iconic in calligraphy. Within the pointed-pen calligraphy umbrella, you have 3 popular styles: Copperplate, Spencerian and Roundhand. 

The Copperplate style was birthed sometime in the 16th century as printers used pointed pens to etch letters into copper plates for mass production of books. Spencerian, Roundhand and even our modern cursive alphabet are modern offshoots of the original Copperplate style. 
## GETTING STARTED

I’m excited to help you learn more about traditional copperplate calligraphy as you develop your own personal style. The objectives within this course are: 

1. Learn and become comfortable with the pointed pen
2. Learn the basics of Copperplate Calligraphy 
3. Learn the basic anatomy of the letterforms        
4. Apply your knowledge of the above to create your own unique lettering        
5. Encourage creativity within your new hobby        
    
This course is not your grandma’s calligraphy class. I take a more post-modern approach to the traditional techniques and practices within calligraphy. 

In art school, one of the biggest things we talked about was how, living in a post-modern era, everything has been done before. As a starry-eyed freshman, there was nothing more depressing than hearing those words come from my professors. As I’ve matured and ventured into the online world, I’ve come to realize that while everything has been done before, no two people are the same. By leveraging the traditional practices of art and calligraphy and inserting your own unique perspective, you will make something that is entirely individual to you. And that is where the true art of lettering lies—in your own personality.

Let’s get going!

### In this lesson, you’ll learn the whats and whys of outfitting yourself with the correct tools and the perfect lettering environment.

You should have your supplies in front of you. If not, head over to [Paper and Ink Arts](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+istilllovecalligraphy.html+) to purchase your supplies for the I Still Love Calligraphy class. One of the fantastic parts of this hobby is that it can easily fit inside a small lunch box! 
 
Paper & Ink Arts is definitely my preferred place for calligraphy supplies, but I've found a lot of local shops have just what I need when I'm in a pinch. You won't find what you need at craft and hobby stores. Hobby Lobby has some inks, but Michael's and JoAnn have nothing. Not much that I would recommend, at least. Hit up art supply stores, university bookstores, vintage stores or specialty stationery shops. 

Let’s break down the materials and why I recommend them.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-1-container-pencils.jpg }}"/>
 
## CONTAINER

One of my favorite things about the hobby/practice of calligraphy is that it takes up very little space. I have a rolling flat storage unit ([Ikea's ALEX](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50167158/#/40196241)), but when I have to take my work on the road it all fits snugly in a small shoe box. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-3-pencil.jpg }}"/>

## PENCIL + ERASER

You’ll definitely need a pencil. Any kind of pencil will work, though I do love [drafting lead holders](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+leadho.html+). You have to purchase leads separately for these kinds of pencils, but you can find a range of soft to hard leads 6H – 6B and everything in between. I personally prefer B and softer leads for my practice work. 

You’ll need a non-marking eraser for drafting your projects (especially when you first start out). I can’t recommend the [Pentel click eraser](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+clic.html+) enough. It cleanly removes pencil markings and the eraser rubber lasts forever. If you have large fields of pencil to erase, a large vinyl eraser works well.

A simple mechanical pencil will do just fine for the purposes of our class, but if you’re like me and get excited about new writing instruments, you’ll like these. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-2-ink.jpg }}"/>
 
## INK

I’ve not tried every single brand of ink out there, but of the brands that I have tried, here are my thoughts on them: 

**FW Acrylic Ink** is basically like thinned out paint. This works remarkably well on dark and rough surfaces. Since it’s like a loose paint, the bottles need to be shaken before use for even consistency. This ink works best with nibs with larger vents. The thickness of the ink doesn’t lend itself towards fine hairlines. It’s great for larger scale letters. 

**Koh-I-Noor India Ink** is an india ink with a loose consistency. It’s perfect for fine points. It dries quickly with a satin charcoal sheen. It’s great for scan and photo work as the hairlines are pronounced even with the finest points. The loose ink works well on most papers, but not Kraft paper (from my experience). 

**Speedball India Ink** should not be confused for Speedball Acrylic ink. The acrylic ink is too gloopy. I’m not a fan. The India ink, however, is a great loose ink for practice and final work. It dries quickly with a completely flat finish with slightly raised texture. Great for both large and small nibs. It has a very readable hairline for photo and scan work. 

**Sumi 60 Ink** is deliciously smooth. It’s a completely opaque ink with the perfect consistency for very delicate hairlines. It doesn’t bleed on loose-weave papers, but it dries with a slight sheen making it difficult for scanning. It has a longer drying time than most inks, so you want to wait at least an hour before touching. It’s the best truly waterproof ink, perfect for mixed media work. 

**Pelikan Brilliant Black** are ideal for fountain pens, but work fabulously for the dip pens. Like Sumi ink, it has super fine hairlines and is completely opaque, but it dries much quicker with a completely flat appearance. Perfect for scanning. 

**Higgins Eternal** is quite thin. Apparently it used to have a more viscous consistency about 15-20 years ago. It’s still the most common practice ink among calligraphers. It’s also most common in art supply stores and one of the most inexpensive inks available. It works well on the Rhodia pad and has nice thin consistency. It’s hit or miss on other papers, though. 

**Iron Gall ink** is a highly corrosive ink that dates back to 70 A.D. The ink is thin and semi-opaque with a bluish black tint to it, but over time turns more opaque and warm. It can be handmade ([recipe](http://irongallink.org/igi_index78f9.html)), but because of its acidic nature, the nib should be cleaned thoroughly during and after use. This is my go-to ink when working with less-than-ideal paper. It doesn’t bleed or feather. It gives very fine hairlines, but not ideal for scanning or photo work.

**McCaffrey’s Penman’s ink** has a very similar feel and composition to the Iron Gall ink and get’s more opaque with time. Very corrosive to nibs if proper care isn’t taken. It’s even lighter than Iron Gall ink. You get very delicate hairlines, perfect for whimsical and romantic work. Over time mold spores may grow (as it is made from organic material) making it mold. It doesn’t go bad, simply pick out the skin and continue use. 

**Walnut Ink** is a very common calligraphy ink used by master penmen and women. It’s a handmade ink that’s lightfast and sepia colored. It can come in liquid or powder form so you can dilute and thicken as you see fit. It’s semi-opaque with very fine hairlines. Dries quickly.

**Windsor & Newton** is similar to FW with its thick consistency, but needs to be stirred more frequently. The black is the best of all the colors offered. 

Windsor & Newton and FW both come in pearlescent colors. Be wary that most of these pearlescents are very thick and can be unruly at times. You may need to water some down or use a larger nib. These shouldn’t be used as you first start out. 

**Pebeo Encre de Chine** is just a delicious ink. Not that I’ve eaten it, but it’s smooth like butter. And I LOVE butter. It’s about the same consistency as the Sumi ink, but has a satin shine. Not ideal for scans or slippery materials, but it leaves a shiny embossed texture on the paper. 

**Ziller Ink** is a smooth paint-like ink that can be pretty thick. It works well on alternate surfaces and dries relatively quickly considering the thickness and type of ink. 

Cool side note: Rich and Vivian (of Ziller Inks) tested their ink to see how well it did in freezing conditions, for those ordering inks online during the winter. These inks did very well with no discernible difference between the quality of ink before or after freezing.

**Manuscript Ink** is a fountain pen ink that comes in the most gorgeous bright blue. It’s stunning when it dries! The thin, semi-opaque ink is easy to work with and dries quickly.

**Private Reserve Ink** has a similar consistency and opacity to Higgins Eternal, but with much better quality. It can feather on some loose-weave papers, but it’s very smooth. Drying times can be slow. 

**Dr. PH Martin's** India ink is semi-transparent and lovely for creating ombre effects. It's a waterproof ink that can gum up your nib if you're not careful to clean your nib during each break. The waterproof nature is ideal for mixed media art projects, though. 

**Dr. PH Martin's pen white is a must buy!** Best white I've used. It's very thick, so shake thoroughly before using. Add a few drops of water if it's still too thick. Doesn't mix well with other brands or colors. 





The price difference between the cheap stuff and the nice stuff is negligible. Get the best ink for the job. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-2-inkaccessories.jpg }}"/> 

Sometimes inks and nibs give you trouble. You may want to consider investing in these accessories to help. 

**Gum Arabic** can be a great medium for fixing ink consistency. It can delay drying times and improve consistency. It can mold and yellow with time, so using it on archival projects may not be a great idea. 

**Gouache** is an opaque water-based paint ideal for mixing up just the right pigment for the job. Mix with water and a junk brush until you get a smooth milk-like consistency. Apply the pigment to the underside of the nib with a small brush. See the video for the full how-to.

**Ink wells and containers** are ideal for inking up your oblique pen or seeing how much ink you have on your nib. [Glass dappen](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+daplid.html+) dishes are traditional for ink mixing, but the lids don’t seal. If you plan on traveling with your ink or you have curious children, you'll want something you can close. [Small glass vials](http://www.specialtybottle.com/58dramclearshortieglassvialwblkcap.aspx) are perfect.  

The jars above are wider than small vials, so I find I'm constantly tipping the jars to get enough ink on my nib. I use a piece of sticky tack to keep the jar tilted at the perfect angle. I snatched this idea from fellow calligrapher, [Fozzy](http://thefozzybook.com/). 

## PEN NIB

The pen nib is probably the scariest thing about all of your new supplies. What the heck is this? Let’s go over the anatomy to get you better acquainted.

# Anatomy of a Pen Nib
<img src="{{ 2-supplies-3-anatomy-nib.png }}"/> 

- Tip/point: the small point allows for hairline strokes
- Slit: it allows the ink to flow down towards the point
- Tines: they separate based on pressure, creating the iconic thicks and thins
- Shoulder: where the pen transitions from the shank to the tip
- Vent: this allows the ink to flow evenly downward towards the point
- Shank: It serves two purposes, to hold the nib in the pen and to house the ink. 
- Tail/base: this is what goes into the nib holder. When purchasing new nibs/holders, make sure that they’re compatible with one another. Some nib holders are made for bigger/smaller nibs. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-4-nibsataglance.jpg }}"/>

I recommend that you purchase a few nibs as you start out. Pictured above are a few of my favorite nibs ranging from the super fine to the bold and sturdy. Each nib has a vastly different personality that yields different results. 

You basically need to “date” your nibs to see if your personalities blend well together. I definitely have my favorites, but I switch out depending on the style I’m after or what surface I’m writing on. You’ll want to head over to your local art supply store or Paper & Ink Arts to explore your options. Since each nib is typically under $2, it’s nice to purchase a large assortment when starting out.

Here’s the breakdown of recommended nibs and their strengths: 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-5-huntnibs.jpg }}"/>

Hunt nibs are among the most common around and a great brand to start with.

- **Hunt 22** – fine hairline with medium-bold drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands.

- **Hunt 56** – medium hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands and for rough surfaces. Best with thicker inks.

- **Hunt 101** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Great for heavy hands. I find this my go-to for Spencerian styling.

-  **Hunt 100** – superfine hairline with medium drama from the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. These nibs are fun, but expire quickly. 

- **Hunt 103** – superfine hairline with medium-bld drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Retains enough ink for about 1-2 letters. 

- **Hunt 108** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Requires a crowquill holder. Fun for flourishwork. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-6-esterbrooknibs.jpg }}"/>

Esterbrook is not quite as common, but they're a lot of fun to mess around with. All ideal on a smaller scale.

- **Esterbrook 355** – fine hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands. This holds more ink than the Hunt 101 or 103, I tend to use this for writing out long thank you letters.

- **Esterbrook 354** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Holds more ink than other small nibs, but still gives a lot of detail on a small scale.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-7-gillotnibs.jpg }}"/>

If you go to an art store with any selection of calligraphy supplies, you'll find these nibs. Gillott, much like Hunt, offers a lot of variety within their line of nibs.

- **Gillott 1068a** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, unpredictable surfaces and large scales. The nib is very rigid, perfect for print work (i.e. addressing envelopes).

- **Gillott 303** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Not ideal for rough surfaces.

- **Gillott 404** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. It's ideal for thick inks and heavy hands.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-8-brausenibs.jpg }}"/>

Most Brause nibs are for broad pen calligraphy like Italic and Gothic, but they have a few pointed pens that I love. These are my current go-to nibs for just about any  project.

- **Brause ef66** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy and light hands, larger scales, rough surfaces and runnier ink. 

- **Brause 511** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Great with runnier inks and hairline flourishes.

- **Brause 513** – fine hairline with light-medium drama on the downstrokes. Great for light hands, heavy hands, large and small scales. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-9-hirozebragnibs.jpg }}"/>

These two brands are a little bit harder to find, but they're equally fun to test out. They're not in tight rotation, but they're still great.

- **Hiro 40** – medium hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, huge scales, thick ink and rough surfaces.

- **Zebra G** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. This is a favorite among a lot of calligraphers, but it's not my go-to. It's got some flexibility and a lot of durability, perfect for heavy hands or beginners. Great with large scale pieces. 

If you have access to antique shops or estate sales, try looking for vintage nibs! Often times you can find a grab bag of nibs for very little and they're so fun to experiment with. 

You’ll want to be sure to protect your nibs and store them in a small, protective container. Baby food jars, Altoid tins and tic tac boxes are all great options for housing your nibs.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-10-nibholder.jpg }}"/>
 
## NIB HOLDER

There are various types of holders: large plastic, large wood, oblique and small plastic. 

Small plastic holders (far left) are easy to find. Because of their scale, It’s a different feel than regular pens, and forces your brain to approach the pen differently. One of the biggest hurtles in learning calligraphy is how to draw with the pointed pen. If you're struggling with changing your mindset from writing to drawing, I would recommend this holder. It works with Brause, Esterbrook and the small hunt nibs. The crowquill holder looks similar, but doesn't have a ball in the center of the holder. The crowquill holder can be fun to use, but most crowquill nibs are more advanced with fine points and flexible tines which can make smooth upstrokes difficult.

You can find simple straight and ergonomic holders with a shellacked wood and metal teeth in the middle. They're great, accommodate every nib (besides crowquill) but are more of an investment. If you're a messy calligrapher, you'll find the wood cracks and chips with abuse.

The speedball straight holder is a great, cheap holder that accommodates just about every nib. If the nib is too loose, I wrap the base of the nib with a small piece of tape then insert. These holders are all plastic, clean easily and don't crack or chip.

Straight holders are ideal for upright angles and oblique holders are best suited for traditional or more dramatic calligraphy angles. I use both styles and holders interchangeably, though. The speedball holder (left) is inexpensive and suitable for both left and right-handed calligraphers. You can find some really neat handmade oblique holders at [John Neal Bookseller](http://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/133), [Unique Obliques](http://www.etsy.com/shop/UniqueObliques) and [Yoke Pen Company](http://www.yokepencompany.com). The far right holder was inherited from my great-great grandfather. I love having it with me, but it's not comfortable to use. Finding a holder that fits comfortably in your hand is very important.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-11-nibplacement.jpg }}"/>

Placing your nib in the holder can be tricky especially if it’s a straight holder with metal teeth or an oblique holder.

For fitting the nib in a straight holder, place your nibs along the outside of the metal teeth. You can adjust the teeth outward for a tighter or looser fit, depending upon your nib size.

![/1-oblique-pen-positioning.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/calligraphy/client/1-oblique-pen-positioning.jpg)

For fitting the nib in an oblique holder, you want to place the holder on the table with the flange pointing away from you and on the left-hand side of the pen’s staff. Insert the nib facing inward slightly. If you’re a lefty, you’ll want to have pen resting on the table with the flange pointing away from you and to the right-hand side of the pen’s staff. Insert facing inward just slightly. See above for the breakdown.

If you have a brass flange, you can bend the flange by hand in towards the main body of the holder. Be careful to avoid bending it too far. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-14-cleaners.jpg }}"/>

## CLEANER

Traditionally you can use ink cleaner, which is a mixture of glycerin and some kind of cleaner. You can find that at your local art supply store. Fact is, it lasts forever but it’s terribly messy. Heaven forbid that your local toddler gets into it and spills its dark, inky contents everywhere! 

I have a small jar of water and a quarter sheet of [Yoke pen wipes](http://www.yokepencompany.com/collections/accessories/products/yoke-pen-company-nib-pen-wipe-sample-pack). I’ll dip my nib into the water and wipe the inky contents off on the lint-free wipe. If I don’t have one of those on-hand, I’ll use water and a paper towel or clorox wipes or baby wipes. 

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-13-paper.jpg }}"/>

## PAPER

You can’t always pick the kind of paper that you work on, especially if you’re doing projects like addressing envelopes. Here are some of my favorite ink-friendly papers:

- Rhodia Pad (pictured left) - available gridded and plain
- Vintage Wallpaper, although not archival
- Scrapbooking Paper
- 100% cotton rag Paper (Moab, Strathmore, Mohawk)
- Watercolor Paper (great for a rugged texture)
- Metallic Paper
- Paper specifically for laser printing

Rule of thumb: if it’s high quality or coated, you’ll be happy with the results. And stay away from "Calligraphy" pads from the art supply store. That paper is better suited for other types of calligraphy. You'll find your nib will skip with nearly each upstroke.

## ENVIRONMENT

Having the correct environment is more important than you might think. Here are some things you’ll want to think about as you set up your space:

- Lots of elbowroom
- A large scrap paper underneath work
- Cleaner and paper towels at the ready
- Minimal distractions
- Computer for spell checking (if needed)
- No carpet, if at all possible (my studio’s carpet is completely stained)
- Wear an apron
- Roll up sleeves
- Pull back hair
- Plenty of good lighting
- Kids at bay

I try to run through this list as I work on any calligraphy project. I’ve been lettering for some time and know how frustrating it is to completely ruin a project because of a little distraction.  The stakes tend to grow quickly as a piece develops, and that’s when a toddler/husband/cat will sneak up behind you and bump your elbow.

## ADDITIONAL TIPS

Advice given from recent student Karina Lim, about ordering supplies if you're in the Indonesia/Singapore/Malaysia areas: 

*THE ESSENTIALS*

Such as holders nibs, dedicated inks ordering online from the standards such as paper ink arts is best for range and price (by far, even with dreaded shipping) and staff helpfulness. Even if your local art shop carries any supplies, they are likely clueless about anything copperplate and will only give you misinformation or be unable to help you with your questions.

*THE EXTRAS*

For stationery & storage, nib organizers: try the following chain book/ lifestyle stores: 'Popular', Kinokuniya (pens), Daiso, Japan Home, Muji. You know my nib storage box is a nail art organizer box from Daiso.

Art Friend's good for brushes, paints, palettes, watercolor paper etc... But not copperplate calligraphy supplies. Overjoyed seems to be the only place in Singapore that stocks Rhodia pads. 

I still haven't found the ideal source of color mixing containers/ ink dipping containers... its kinda makeshift right now. 

Malaysia has a lot of the same chain stores. 

And Indonesians are always traveling into Singapore to shop/ holiday/ work... so if they had too, they could get supplies here. I think online shopping and shipping isn't so straightforward for them... don't know if it's gotten better. 

I hope that was helpful from a student's perspective!

### In this lesson, you will learn the basic anatomy of a letter and identifying the basic strokes in each letter.

# basic anatomy of the letter
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-1-basic-anatomy.png }}"/>

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, many of the letterforms mimic one another. There are basic shapes within the English alphabet that make up each letter: miniscules for lowercase letters and majuscules for uppercase letters. Mastering these strokes in muscle memory will allow you to be more consistent in your lettering and flourishes. In each calligraphy discipline (Roundhand, Spencerian, Engrosser’s script, etc) there are different basic strokes. The basic strokes below are a simplified version of those strokes according to the book of Melissa. 

Before we go into those basic shapes, let's talk about the basic anatomy of a letter: 

- **Ascender line:** the top guide line at which letters stop
- **Waistline/Header:** the middle line, where the lowercase letters hit or where strokes ‘pinch’
- **Baseline:** the bottom line where characters sit
- **Descender line:** the lowest guide line at which letters go
- **Backbone:** the spine or primary line of capital letters
- **Bowl:** the curved line
- **Counter space:** the interior space (open or closed) of a curved line
- **Loop:** the enclosed counter of a letter, usually a descender or ascender
- **Descender:** the part of a letter that descends below the baseline
- **Ascender:** the part of a letter that ascends above the waistline
- **Leg:** the bottom stroke of a letter (as seen in K, R, L, etc)
- **X-height:** the distance between the baseline and waistline
- **Slope/Angle line:** the angle at which the letters lean
- **Shade:** the widest point of the letter’s line-weight, always a downstroke
- **Hairline:** the finest point of the letter’s line-weight, always an upstroke or horizontal stroke

# basic miniscules
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-2-basic-miniscules.png }}"/>

## MINISCULES

Each lowercase letter in the alphabet (save a few rogues) uses at least one of these shapes. These shapes are written out in the 55º angle traditionally used in Copperplate calligraphy. For ease of use, all diagrams are going to be in a 63º angle. As you practice on your gridded paper, you can recreate the same slope line by lining up the top right corner of one box and the bottom left corner of the box below it with a ruler and penciling in. Grids and slope lines are crucial for getting consistency down with the basics. Even if you plan on executing a meandering style down the road, practicing muscle memory with consistent angles and scales will help you maintain a consistent meandering style. 

- **Intro stroke:** Connects letters together. Start at the baseline and curve upward, visualizing the bottom right hand side of an oval to get that consistent curve. 

- **O stroke:** It’s the foundation and sets the tone for all the other basic strokes in the group. As you can see, the oval shape is repeated throughout the basics. Start on the right-hand side on the hairline and curve counter-clockwise. 

- **I stroke:** This strokes makes up many of the lowercase letters, but can be difficult to achieve since it starts with a thick square. You can use a square or a slightly rounded top, but the stroke is generally at full shade-width from the get-go. Before moving the pen downward, press the tines apart and pull the pen downward. Before turning the curve, release pressure to a hairline, then lightly touch the pen on the way up, making sure the stroke finishes at the waistline.

- **Wavy stroke:** It looks like an ~, and navigates the exterior space between two ovals side-by-side. Start with a hairline, slowly add pressure as you turn the curve, and start to release it at the mid-point of the x-height. Transition to a hairline just before making the curve at the baseline and finish at the waistline.

- **Ascender stroke:** This stroke makes up most ascender stroke letters (although a few don’t have a loop, like the t and d). Start at the waistline with a hairline, curving around, making the counter-space make a similar curve to the oval in the o stroke. Slowly transition to a shade and keep the pressure all the way down. Finish by releasing pressure upwards. 

- **Descender stroke:** This stroke is used for most letters with a descender (except for p, q and f). Start the stroke off similar to the i stroke with tines separated before moving downward. Maintain pressure until the curve approaches. Release pressure before the curve to a hairline. Finish out the stroke with a loop up to the waistline. 

- **Commadot:** This stroke is used in various forms for flourishing and in lowercase letters. Start just below the waistline, curving up and pressing the tines down as you curve around, making a filled circle. Finish out the stroke to the waistline in a hairline stroke. 

# basic anatomy of the stroke
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-5-stroke-anatomy.png }}"/>

Notice above where the thick lines transition to the thin lines. Be aware of where that starts to taper off and get ahead of it in your own practice. Most strokes start top-left and work their way down, but it’s not always the case. Making sure to transition from thick to thin early enough is key to making your basic strokes look clean and professional.

# basic majuscules
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-3-basic-majuscules.png }}"/>

## MAJUSCULES

The uppercase characters aren’t nearly as predictable as the lowercase, but you’ll still find many of the same forms repeated throughout.

Uppercase letters of the alphabet in the Copperplate style are, in my mind, flourished versions of lowercase letters. They often have similar basic structure to the lower case letters, but with a bit more majesty. So as you look at the basic structures that compose the uppercase letters versus the basic strokes that compose flourishes, you see a considerable amount of overlap.

- **Swelled stroke:** This stroke makes up the backbone of most uppercase letters it resembles a / more than an S in curvature. Start with a hairline, swell into the full shade at the waistline, then taper back into the hairline by the base. A slight oval-inspired curve at the top and bottom are made. 

- **Lead-in Loop:** This loop is the lead-in flourish of many uppercase letters. It’s not always the case, but in the alphabet I’ve put together, you do. As you form your own style you may end up nixing this particular stroke all-together. Start at the waistline and curve up to the ascender line, curve downward with the same curvature of the oval in the o stroke, but cut in a little earlier to exit out of the loop. 

- **9 swirl:** A spiral stroke that goes against the grain. Start at the baseline and curve all the way up and to the left, meeting at the ascender line. Curve downward and swell. Cut in a little early and taper into a hairline. As you terminate the stroke, double back on the line to create a comma dot (totally optional, but fun to practice for other styles of calligraphy). 

- **Stunt Swirl:** This loop is used often in flourishing. It’s basically the same as the lead-in loop, but at a larger scale spanning form the baseline to the ascender line.

## BASIC FLOURISH STROKES

Flourishes can be broken down into 4 basic stroke styles. Once you have the shapes down committed to muscle memory, it’s not hard at all to combine.

I approach combining each basic stroke much like a choreographer would combine basic dance steps to create a ballet, but we’ll talk more about flourishes, later.

### In this lesson, you’ll learn basic techniques on how to properly hold the pen and how much ink to use.

One of the biggest hurtles of learning calligraphy is learning how to use the pointed pen. For some, this comes naturally; for others there’s nothing more frustrating. Of the students that I’ve taught over the years, the ones who pick up the lettering fastest are the ones that recognize the difference between writing with a ballpoint pen and drawing with a pointed pen.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-1-hold-correct.jpg }}"/>

## HOLDING THE PEN

Think back to when you were learning to print your name in primary school. My teachers emphasized holding the pencil correctly. This technique is the same in calligraphy. Pick the pen up near the nib with your index and thumb. Allow the top of the pen to rest on the knuckle of your index finger. The bottom of the pen will rest on the bone between the tip and the joint of your middle finger. You should be holding your pen at about a 40º angle from the paper.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-1-hold-incorrect.jpg }}"/>

DO NOT hold the pen in a vice grip (see above for what NOT to do). It’s nearly impossible to achieve the correct angle to allow the tines to separate on the downstrokes and to avoid skipping on the upstrokes.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-4-angled-nib.jpg }}"/>

## ANGLE OF THE NIB

You want to make sure that the shoulders of the nib are always pointing downward, the shank’s curvature is pointing upwards.

The direction of your pen should point parallel to your downstroke. When using the straight holder you will be more naturally inclined to write at a more upright angle. To change to a more dramatic angle comfortably, rotate your paper more dramatically counter-clockwise or switch to an oblique holder.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-3-pressure.jpg }}"/>

## PRESSURE

You’ll be so surprised at how little you have to press on the paper in order to make a mark. Gravity is working with you, so all you have to do to make a hairline stroke is to touch the fibers of the paper (just a little) and move your pen. As long as you have enough ink on your nib, you should barely be grazing the paper as you make your upstrokes.

Clearly you want to press harder as you make your down strokes. You want to leave the tines behind as you press and drag. This will allow the ink to spread between the two lines and make the wide marks. You’ll be surprised at how much abuse your pen can take, but be warned, you want to keep your pen at the 40º angle when doing the down strokes. If your pen is too upright as you make your wide strokes, your tines will bend permanently.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-2-inked-pen.jpg }}"/>

## INK


When inking up your nib, you want to make sure you have the right amount of ink; not too much and not too little. Dip your nib into the ink well past the vent. As you take the nib out of the well, scrape excess ink from front and back sides of the nib along the mouth of the jar. Alternatively you could apply the pigment to the underside of the nib with a small brush.


When you first start out, you’ll want to make preliminary marks on a scratch sheet of paper to see how much or little ink is on your nib. Also, if it’s the first time that you’re inking your nib, the ink will likely try to pull off the nib. This is because there’s a fine layer of oil covering your nib. Make sure the nib is prepped properly. Clean the nib with toothpaste and the ink should adhere to the nib and flow down evenly.


If you find your nib is not making a mark, clean off your nib with the wet wipe and dip again. Also, try scratching at the paper. The downside to using waterproof ink is that it can dry and harden at the point, creating a block in the flow. Scratch the dried ink off of the tip to restore flow.

      Once you’ve mastered the basic strokes with your pencil, it’s time to move on to the pointed pen! Practice the basic strokes with the pointed pen.

Practice your miniscules as many times as it takes to get familiar with the pen. Practicing exercise 2 and/or 3 is a great way to warm up before future assignments. If you’re having a hard time getting it right, be sure to upload your project to the assignment [gallery](/#!/gallery). I’ll help you troubleshoot.

### In this lesson, you will learn the basic directions on how to take the miniscules and majuscules from the previous lesson and incorporate them into forming the words. You will practice the letters with both a pencil and the pointed pen.

Now that you have your basic strokes worked out, you’ll want to move onto forming the actual letters. You’ll find that the letters in the copperplate style are not much different than the cursive letters you practiced in school. Cursive originated from Copperplate calligraphy, so thank the third grade for making this much easier.

# character map
<img src="{{ 5-letterforms-1-character-map.png }}"/>

When forming your letters, typically uppercase, it might be a little tricky to figure out where to start. As a general rule of thumb, you start from the top left corner and work your way down. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but as you practice on your worksheet, you’ll find that even the rogue letters do follow a similar pattern as far as the construction is concerned.

Much like pronouncing a word with the right emphasis on each syllable, thick strokes emphasize and give structure to your lettering.

# incorrect emphasis
<img src="{{ 5-letterforms-2-emphasis.png }}"/>

Notice how changes in emphasis affect the letterform. Keep this in mind as you learn to deconstruct each letter and look for clues on where to start each stroke.

### In this lesson, you will learn the importance of spacing the letters evenly.

Once you feel comfortable with your letterforms, making the jump to writing out words and sentences is only natural. As you add letters to form words, try to visualize one or two letters ahead.  Try to see where your pen needs to go to link the letters. This will help you to avoid mistakes. 


As you continue to each letter of a word, you’ll recognize a certain flow occurs. Be mindful of that flow and keep it consistent. This is called kerning. Keeping your letter-spacing consistent will work wonders to your lettering as you figure out your own personal style.

# correct letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 6-wordforms-1-letterspacing-correct.png }}"/>


Changing up your kerning for different projects will vastly change the way your lettering feels and reads.

# incorrect letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 6-wordforms-2-letterspacing-incorrect.png }}"/>


Helpful tips in keeping kerning consistent:


Keep the same speed as you write out each letter. My mantra (thanks Phil from Modern Family) is Slow is Smooth and Smooth is Fast. Work slowly through each letter and you’ll find that mistakes happen a lot less frequently.


As you start a project, you’ll want to pencil out your letters very lightly. From here you can fix the letter-spacing to keep the project consistent. When you finalize it with the pointed pen, you’ll find yourself stressing less and focusing more on perfecting the thick and thin strokes.

### In this lesson, you will learn the basics of appropriately adding flourishes to a word or project as well as the basics to make your own impromptu flourish shapes.

Flourishes are a fun way to add a lot of punch to a project. I look at flourishes like the dessert course of a fantastic meal. Flourishes are best when used in small doses like at the beginning or end of a word.

# where to put flourishes
<img src="{{ 7-flourishes-3-placement.png }}"/>

There are three places that work best for adding flourishes:

1. for punctuation or crossing t’s and dotting i’s
2. at the beginning and/or ending of a word or line
3. underneath or around a word or phrase


Flourishes should add more dynamics to the word or phrase, not decrease readability. Use flourishes in small doses.

# basic flourishes
<img src="{{ 7-flourishes-1-basic-flourishes.png }}"/>

The basic flourish strokes as seen above can be added with one another in a wide variety of ways.

# examples of flourish combinations
<img src="{{ 7-flourishes-2-combining-basic-strokes.png }}"/>

Above are some examples of how to incorporate the basic flourish strokes with one another. When writing with ornate styling, I typically steer away from dramatic thicks and thins in flourishes to create a hierarchy between the word and the flourish.

Modern calligraphy is whatever you want it to be. With the basics of Copperplate, you have the tools to infuse your own personal style and writing into something fantastic. Depending upon the kind of person you are (do you change handwriting “fonts” every day?), this can be surprisingly easy or extremely challenging.

To get going on your on personal style, ask yourself a few questions and write out your rules in the form of practice phrases.

## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF
### These questions are meant for you to find your style and determine the look and feel you’re hoping to achieve with that style.

# baseline
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-1-baseline.png }}"/>

The straight baseline reads more formal and the curvy baseline, more informal. When using the curvy baseline, you do want to mark out where the general line is to keep the word from curving downward or upward.

# ascenders
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-2-ascenders.png }}"/>

# descenders
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-3-descenders.png }}"/>

Figure out what your ascenders and descenders are doing. Are they big and loopy? Short and narrow? This feeds into the feeling of your style, but doesn’t necessarily lean your letters more formal or casual. If I’m working on a project with multiple lines, I’ll typically make my ascenders and descenders shorter.

# thickness
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-4-thickness.png }}"/>

The thickness of your stroke depends upon the scale and type of nib you’re using. Thick downstrokes are great for projects that will need a big impact.

# width
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-5-width.png }}"/>

I choose my width based on the project I’m doing and how I want it to fill the space given.

# letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-7-letterspacing.png }}"/>

I choose my letter spacing based on the project. Wide letter spacing tends to be more casual.

# angle
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-6-angle.png }}"/>

The more upright  my letters are, the more casual they appear. Letters leaning to the right are a lot easier to draw than letters leaning to the left. I wouldn’t recommend experimenting with left-leaning letters until you’re proficient and comfortable with the traditional angle of letters.

# ornamentation
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-8-ornamentation.png }}"/>

Ornamentation goes back to the flourish section. Adding flourishes quickly formalizes your style. When working on the flourishes, make sure that you take into consideration the spacing, angling and thickness of your letters.

The biggest thing I can stress to making it yours is to create rules for yourself and STAY CONSISTENT. Consistency is key. Making calligraphy yours is something to work on once you get comfortable with the pointed pen. Don’t forget that getting good takes time and lots of practice. I love to see your progress!

# Supplies

Through years of trial and error, I’ve found the following to be ideal when addressing envelopes: 

**A high-quality envelope**

*  [LCI Paper](http://www.lcipaper.com/)
*  [Paper Presentation](http://paperpresentation.com/)
*  [Paper Source](http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/envelopes/envelopes.html) 
*  [American Crafts](http://www.americancrafts.com/default.aspx?PageID=49&CategoryID=16)

I’m not familiar with all brands of envelopes, but I've had fabulous luck with all envelopes I've ordered from the above sources.

Mowhawk, Cougar and Moab are fine paper companies that make high-quality papers that will work with ink. 

I’ve also found that some coated metallic envelopes are typically awesome with ink and quite forgiving (to the point where you can literally wipe off mistakes if you catch them early enough!). 

**Brilliant Inks**

[Windsor & Newton Gouache](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+wnser1.html+) - mix any color under the sun with some water, gouache and a little gum arabic (the gum arabic helps consistency and lengthens drying time). Watercolor could be used as well, but gouache’s opacity and thickness do well on just about any paper type.

[Dr Martin’s Pen White](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+penwht.html+) - this white ink is thick and brilliant. You will need to thin it out with several drops of water, but it’ll shine brightly on any dark surface. 

[Ziller North Wind White](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+zilwhi.html+) - I've started to prefer this white over Dr. Martin's Pen white recently. It's already the right consistency out of the jar and still gives brilliant, fine opaque hairlines. 

[Dr. Martin’s Iridescent Copperplate Gold](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+irides---gld.html) - FW and Windsor & Newton golds don’t compare to Dr. Martin’s copperplate gold. It’s bright on any surface and it doesn’t gunk up your fine nibs quite like other brands do. The gold flecks settle quickly so lots of shaking is required. 

[Finetec Arabic Gold](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+arabic.html) - you can get a whole gold pallete, but if you’re not sure how you’re going to like it, you can get refill pots for about $4 each. Add water with a small brush and apply to the underside of the nib. It’s a bright, bright metallic that needs no shaking.

**Drying Rack**

Simply placing the envelope on a flat surface until it’s dry is totally fine. However, if you’re addressing more than 10 envelopes at a time, you may want to get some help to keep that precious desk space clear. 

![drying rack]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-15-drying-rack.jpg }})

I found this mail sorter at my local thrift store for next to nothing. The rack makes all the difference when I’m doing multiple lettering projects at once. 

Beware, however. If you’re using really thin ink that tends to drip, you may want to find a more horizontal solution for drying organization. Make a test piece to find out if the above applies to any project. 

**Rulers**

You’ll want a clear gridded ruler for making marks on dark envelopes. I’ve found quilting rulers to do the trick, but it's what I had on-hand. You’ll want something with a clear grid for making easy parallel lines like [this one](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+cthrul.html).

**Light Table**

If you’re lettering a lot on plain papers or envelopes and you don’t want to mess with penciling out your guides, use a [light table](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KNHRH6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KNHRH6&linkCode=as2&tag=il0c6-20). I don’t use mine often, but when I do, it’s such a huge time saver. If you're in a pinch and you need a light table asap, try using the bright screen of an iPad or tablet! It works like a charm.

![/phantom-liner-2.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/calligraphy/client/phantom-liner-2.jpg)

**Phantom Liner**

If you're lettering on a lot of opaque paper, light or dark, a [phantom liner](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+phn100.html+) comes in handy! It's available in two sizes: small and large. I have both, but tend to use the small liner the most. It just fits so nicely on my desk when I want perfect precision and consistency with my spacing. 

For dark papers or sub-ideal lighting, get a small lamp to light the paper *underneath* the phantom liner. This will create less fatigue on the eyes while working. I tend to use my phone in flashlight mode. 

#  My Rules

Addressing envelopes is so much fun, but there are a few rules that you might want to know to help make addressing letters (and in bulk) easy, look beautiful and get through the postal system. 

Most postal services are automated, so by hand-writing your address you’re automatically put into the “manually sort” pile. [The USPS](http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/addressing/deliveryAddress.htm) has some great suggestions, but most don’t apply to hand-lettered addresses. Here are my guidelines: 

*   Put the return address on the same side as the destination address if it ends up undeliverable. 
*   The address should be parallel (or mostly parallel) to the longest side.
*   Write no smaller than 1/8 inch tall.
*   Letter the important stuff simply.
*   Use high contrast with your paper and ink.
*   Hand-lettered mail pieces take much longer to deliver.

![address guidelines]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-1-intro-a.png }})

Below are guidelines (with some opinions from me) based on this article by the [USPS](http://pe.usps.com/text/qsg300/Q602.htm).

*   The return address takes up to 1/2 of the envelope’s width and 1/3 of the envelope’s height. 
*   The postage should be located at the upper right hand side of the envelope. 
*   The recipient’s address should be left justified on the lower two-thirds of the envelope. Traditionally I’ve found that each line gets indented, but that’s just what I employ with my style. 
*  1/2 inch spacing should be left at either side of the envelope and 5/8 inch at the bottom for handling and barcodes. 
*   It’s recommended that the ZIP remain on the same line as the City and State. I tend to keep it on there, but if it’s going to fit better on the next line, I’ll move it to the next line. 
*   Never forget to put Country information on there (even sender info) if sending an envelope to another country. I don’t tend to mess with what goes on what lines when sending an envelope to another country.

Deviations from these may not necessarily denote a letter as undeliverable, but may create delivery delays. Often times it's not required to write the return address on the front of the envelope, but if you're unsure if the address will be decipherable, you may want to include that on the front. 

I’ve found personally, that Chicago mail is a LOT less forgiving than other cities for fancy addresses. Mail times are doubled, tripled or returned for that area. 

 _If you have any experience good or bad with certain cities or states, let me know in the comments so I can add as much info here about mail times as possible, thanks!_

# Readability

![readability]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-14-readability.jpg }})

The most important aspect of lettering your envelopes isn’t style or composition, but readability. There are so many styles out there, and your style is uniquely you! Make sure that each letter reads correctly. 

In my experience, I’ve found the following letters (and numbers) often get mis-read: 

*  1 and 7 - they’re so hard to differentiate from each other. I’ve found that if I use a simple line for the 1 or add a base hairline to the 1, it doesn’t ever get confused for a 7. Conversely, I like to add a little flick at the beginning stroke of my 7 to differentiate it from 1.
*  U and V - Some Vs have a curved bottom, which can throw everything off. If you’re flourishing a curvy V at the exit stroke, you’ll want to keep those flourishes above the baseline as to avoid any confusion for the U. 
*  b and f and s - if you’re using a curved baseline, the b could easily be mistaken for an f. If you’re using an alternate f where the loop goes the opposite way, it could be easily mistaken for a loopy s. 

In the above pictures, I share my alternates that tend to read better when using non-traditional baseline and styles. This is all according to the book of Melissa and how I’ve seen things work. It’s certainly up to you how you deploy your own style in addressing envelopes. 

# Simply Lettered

![simple styling]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-2-sample.jpg }})

Simple styling is a-okay! With so much junk mail and chicken scratch, even the simplest address will make quite the impression. 

I’ve found that tight leading can be nice, but be careful of descenders and ascenders connecting and mucking up important information. You’ll see that above my P from Pike and R from ridge connect kind of awkwardly. Thankfully the intersection doesn’t affect readability, but I would re-do this address if I were lettering for a client. If this were the address of a thank you note or even for an invitation from me personally, I’d likely send as-is. 

Perfection is expected for client work, but not for personal work. According to the book of Melissa. 

# Ornamentation

![sample ornamentation]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-3-sample.jpg }})

Here’s another simple sample with slight ornamentation to the names only. You can go bananapants crazy on the names because that information isn’t crucial for the postman to know for delivery. It’s also a blast for recipients to see their name fancified. Win-win!

Above you can see that I’ve simply written out the address portion of each address (recipient and sender) in an all-caps print with slight shading on the downstrokes. It’s personal, unique, but easy for your postman to read. I like putting in little swirls here and there (not many, but note the N) for just a little flair of fancy. 

The red envelope is a mid-tone which would work just fine with either black, white -or in this case - silver. 

# Mixing Styles

![sample print]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-4-sample.jpg }})

The above, I used a brush for the first name and made it HUGE. then used a simple all-caps print with slight shading for the rest of the address. The large type and leading between lines makes the recipient’s address very clear to read.  

# Centered Text

![sample centered]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-5-sample-b.jpg }})

If I’m opting to put the return address on the back side, I’ll usually center the address. I do this if I’m not necessarily concerned with the mail being returned to me if it’s deemed undeliverable, but it’s really up to personal preference. 

**The piece on the left:** 
*  The name is larger
*  I’ve used heavy shading for the style element
*  Key address information is in a shaded all-caps
*  ZIP is on the same line, line is accentuated by dots on either side

**The piece on the right:**
*  The name is larger
*  I’ve used very little shading
*  Some flourishes used at the ends of the capitals
*  Key address information is in a Title Case print with similar styling as the script above
*  ZIP is on a separate line with hearts as a little detail on either side

# Loaded and Stacked

![sample stacked](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-addressingenvelopes-5-sample.jpg)

What do you do when you have a narrow envelope and a *really* long address? I’ve found this to work effectively, write the street number large and stacking the street name to the same height as the number. It’s readable, it fits nicely within the composition and it’s different! 

For the sake of your postman, I wouldn’t recommend going super fancy or flourish-y with your style if you’re having to stack information like above. 

# High Contrast

![contrast](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-addressingenvelopes-6-contrast.jpg)

If you’re a little obsessed with collecting - and using - colorful inks, you’ll want to make sure that your envelope and ink have the most contrast possible. The image above doesn’t do the samples justice, but in person, the really fine hairline piece on the left is much easier to read than the much bolder gold on the right. 

The more contrast you can provide with the envelope and ink, the easier it’s going to be to read and the faster it’s going to reach the recipient. 

# Using Guides

Most of my letters are addressed by hand without guides. I’m usually deploying an organic style that lends itself towards organic baselines and spacing or I’m in a hurry. Or both. But when I want my lines to come out the same every time, I have a method for that. 

![white ruled]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-7-rulers-white.jpg }})

With white or light colored envelopes that may be semi-transparent, I’ll cut a sheet of cardstock just shy of the width of my envelope opening and about 2-3 inches taller. 

From the bottom, I’ll line up my grid to the bottom of the sheet and measure up at least 5/8 of an inch. From there I’ll measure every quarter of an inch or so. This may vary depending upon the style and size of the envelope you’re using. 

![white ruled]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-8-rulers-white.jpg }})
 
I’ll slip the paper in the envelope, making sure that the bottom of my guide is square with the bottom of the envelope. Then I’ll letter as planned. If the paper is a little less transparent, you may be able to deploy this method in conjunction with a light table. 

![rulers white]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-9-rulers-white.jpg }})

With the guides set in place, you’re ready to address as many invitations as you need without penciling in any lines. 

If you’re struggling with consistent x-height, leading and slope of your letters, you may want to make a guide sheet with all of that information on there. 

But what if you have an envelope that’s so opaque a light box won’t make a difference? Get your ruler out. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-10-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Get your ruler out and mark the bottom baseline. Here I’m deploying a slanted baseline. I just eyeball where I want that to go for the first line, then slowly move my ruler up and use the parallel guides to make each line. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-11-rulers-dark.jpg }})

As you letter your guides, you may want to make more than necessary. Be sure to lightly mark your paper for easy erasing afterward. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-12-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Letter your piece and allow ink to dry completely before erasing. If you’re using a coated envelope with non-waterproof ink, you may want to wait a little longer than normal to erase guidelines. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-13-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Erase those little lines and BAM, the recipient won’t have a clue the awesomeness that’s about to head their way.

![/phantom-liner-3.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/calligraphy/client/phantom-liner-3.jpg)

If you have a phantom liner, you don't have to write out guidelines at all. Simply adjust the liner (directions in the box) for the thickness of your writing material, and letter away! 

![/phantom-liner-1.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/calligraphy/client/phantom-liner-1.jpg)

The liner comes with printed guides you can use, but you can make your own if you so desire! If you're including angle lines, imagery or text, be sure to reverse it. 

# Upload Guidelines

*  Scans are okay, but to save me time from downloading and opening with a third party app, please snap a photo or **save as a JPG**. 
*  Snapping a photo in natural light or a well-lit area will give me the most information to work off of. 
*  Try to keep uploads to one page (or one photo) per assignment. Seeing the whole exercise at a glance helps me provide you with more feedback.
*  Be descriptive! Include information on **nib**, **ink**, **paper**, any issues or concerns and if you're a **lefty**. I can give more specific feedback based on those details.

### Here are a few extra tidbits about calligraphy that are good to know. Have I forgotten anything? Email me at [melissa@melissaesplin.com](mailto:melissa@melissaesplin.com)

## THE DIGITAL WORLD

A lot of my calligraphy projects end up in a digital format in one way or another. How do I do this? It all depends.

If I’m looking for a crisp, smooth look, I use my Intuos 4 wacom tablet to write directly in Adobe Illustrator. There are many ways to use the Illustrator tools provided to create calligraphy, but that’s another lesson for another course.

If I want my calligraphy to look rough and hand-drawn, I’ll letter it on paper and scan it. When scanning work into the computer, I scan at 1200-2400 DPI. It sounds completely ridiculous, but if you plan on vectorizing those raw details, you’ll need as much information on that scan as possible. I use the Canon Pixma 970 for scanning and printing.

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND INSPIRATION

There are a lot of great books out there regarding copperplate calligraphy that will be great resources as you embark on your new craft. Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy is a very thorough (albeit traditional) resource. Calligraphy in the Copperplate Style is a quick guide with lots of gorgeous samples.

I also find it most helpful to follow the blogs of other calligraphers, both traditional and modern. Man cannot survive in a vacuum, so I suggest getting involved in the calligraphy community.  Seriously!  Get to know other calligraphers and learn their tricks. Join the I Still Love Calligraphy facebook group! It's a private group just for ISLC alumni. Request to join [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/384322728341174/).

Here are a few of my favorite modern calligraphers and letterers:

## PRICING OUT WORK

Calligraphy is so hot right now! Every blogger, party planner and designer is looking for a calligrapher. So what happens if they ask you to give them a quote on your work? This is a tricky situation, but here’s some advice:

1. Do NOT work for free. You need to charge something, even if you’re a complete amateur and it’s a small amount. If you do end up doing a project for free, let your family member, soul sister or charity know what you would have charged them. By doing so, you protect the industry and educate those around you not to expect this kind of work for free. My two cents: I love what I do, but I like to feed and clothe my children. You should, too.
2. Get a clear idea of what the project entails and give a quote based on how many hours you project the project to take. What I charge for Calligraphy work is similar to what I charge for design work. Design students charge anywhere from $15-30 per hour. Design professionals charge (or should charge) anywhere from $50-200 per hour.
3. Be clear on what clients should expect. There’s nothing worse than pouring time and energy into a project only to find out that they want you to do it again, because they weren’t expecting your style. I clearly state to my clients that they get what they get unless they have made their requirements known beforehand. I also charge extra for revisions (unless I spell something wrong).

This course is clearly not focused on how to monetize your calligraphy skills; however, as your ability grows, you may be surprised by how many people want your help with their projects. Let me know if you have any other questions regarding professional work.

Thanks so much for taking my online course. I do hope this class was helpful! If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know!

Cheers,
*Melissa*
