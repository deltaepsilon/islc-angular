## MY HISTORY

Hello there! It’s Melissa Esplin, of I Still Love You and I’m so excited to share with you my love for calligraphy. This e-course is a long time coming and I’m just thrilled that it’s finally here.

<img src="{{ 1-introduction-1.jpeg }}"/>

My love for lettering and calligraphy goes way, way back; back to the beginning. I’ve never been much for writing, but I love to draw letters. I had the best handwriting in my classes in grade school. I was so eager to learn cursive as a beginning second-grader that I would sneak into the third grade classroom after school and copy down the cursive letters before heading home for the day. I’ve always felt like cursive letterforms are oh so graceful.

Fast forward to 7th grade where I finally took my first art class. We learned about Old English lettering. I immediately found it fascinating, stole my brother’s calligraphy set and wrote out as many words as I could. Typically it was just my name.

Junior high was when the scrapbooking scene hit my house full force. My mom started making layouts and cards and I would make cards along side her. I was never super satisfied with the folksy stamps, so I started hand lettering and illustrating my cards. This was when my dad bought me a copyright and I started making card sets for other people. My little ‘business’ didn’t go anywhere, but I sure did think I was cool.

<img src="{{ 1-introduction-2.jpeg }}"/>

In junior high and high school I got incredibly involved in the art-making scene. In addition to my growing love for the fine arts, I was constantly hand-lettering posters and flyers for friends, school and church events.

As I embarked on my first year of college, I started work at a graphic design firm on campus as an office secretary. It was then that I learned how to actually turn on a computer (how was that in 2003?), send attachments and eventually teach myself the ins and outs of Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. I made the transition to graphic designer within the office and quickly became immersed in the digital world. I completely forgot about my hand lettering.

It wasn’t until 2009, when my friend Jenn posted a gorgeous printable card with her hand lettering that I even thought about how much I loved hand lettering. I saw her gorgeous handwriting and something clicked. I knew I needed to get back to my analog lettering and incorporate that into my design work. How had I let this lay dormant for so long?

## CALLIGRAPHY HISTORY

You have all had exposure to calligraphy in its various forms. Now, if you’re like me, trying to look up videos and books to increase your knowledge on calligraphy. You’ll realize that by just searching “Calligraphy”, you don’t come up with the results that you’re after.

Probably the most common forms of calligraphy include Old English Calligraphy (a lettering style achieved by an angled pen nib) and Chinese Calligraphy (brush lettering in the Chinese language). Now these different styles are really fun to sink your teeth into, but these styles don’t lend themselves to modern interpretation as much as Copperplate Calligraphy does. Copperplate is written with a pointed nib like the calligraphy pens you’ll find at the art store.

“Copperplate” is the umbrella term for using both pointed pen and pressure to create the dramatic thicks and thins that are so iconic in calligraphy. Within the pointed-pen calligraphy umbrella, you have 3 popular styles: Copperplate, Spencerian and Roundhand.

The Copperplate style was birthed sometime in the 16th century as printers used pointed pens to etch letters into copper plates for mass production of books. Spencerian, Roundhand and even our modern cursive alphabet are modern offshoots of the original Copperplate style.

## GETTING STARTED

I’m excited to help you learn more about traditional copperplate calligraphy as you develop your own personal style. The objectives within this course are:

1. Learn and become comfortable with the pointed pen
2. Learn the basics of Copperplate Calligraphy
3. Learn the basic anatomy of the letterforms
4. Apply your knowledge of the above to create your own unique lettering
5. Encourage creativity within your new hobby

This course is not your grandma’s calligraphy class. I take a more post-modern approach to the traditional techniques and practices within calligraphy.

In art school, one of the biggest things we talked about was how, living in a post-modern era, everything has been done before. As a starry-eyed freshman, there was nothing more depressing than hearing those words come from my professors. As I’ve matured and ventured into the online world, I’ve come to realize that while everything has been done before, no two people are the same. By leveraging the traditional practices of art and calligraphy and inserting your own unique perspective, you will make something that is entirely individual to you. And that is where the true art of lettering lies—in your own personality.

Let’s get going!

### In this lesson, you’ll learn the whats and whys of outfitting yourself with the correct tools and the perfect lettering environment.

You should have your supplies in front of you. If not, head over to [Paper and Ink Arts](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+index.html+) to purchase your supplies for the I Still Love Calligraphy class (under the conferences and classes link). One of the fantastic parts of this hobby is that it can easily fit inside a small lunch box and it costs as little as $30 to get completely outfitted!

Paper & Ink Arts is definitely my preferred place for calligraphy supplies, but I've found a lot of local shops have just what I need when I'm in a pinch. You won't find what you need at craft and hobby stores. Hobby Lobby has some inks, but Michael's and JoAnn have nothing. Nothing that I would recommend, at least. Hit up art supply stores, university bookstores or specialty stationery shops.

Let’s break down the materials and why I recommend them.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-1-container-pencils.jpg }}"/>

## CONTAINER

One of my favorite things about the hobby/practice of calligraphy is that it takes up very little space. I have a rolling flat storage unit (Ikea's ALEX), but when I have to take my work on the road it all fits snugly in a small shoe box.
<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-3-pencil.jpg }}"/>

## PENCIL + ERASER

You’ll definitely need a pencil. Any old #2 will work, though I do love drafting lead holders. You can purchase the range of soft to hard leads 6H – 6B and everything in between.

You’ll need a non-marking eraser for drafting your projects (especially when you first start out). I can’t recommend the Pentel white click eraser enough. It cleanly removes pencil markings and the eraser rubber lasts forever.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-2-ink.jpg }}"/>

## INK

I’ve not tried every single brand of ink out there, but of the brands that I have tried; FW, Windsor & Newton, Sumi and DR. PH Martin's are top on my list.

**FW** is an acrylic ink, it's basically like thinned out paint. This works remarkably well on dark and rough surfaces.

**Windsor & Newton** is similar to FW with its thick consistency, but needs to be stirred more frequently. The black is the best of all the colors offered.

**Sumi** is hands down my favorite. It's the most expensive of the inks above, but lasts forever. The mouth of the jar is wide enough for dipping the oblique pen and it glides over any surface smoothly. This particular ink leaves a shiny raised texture, not ideal for scanning.

**Speedry** is semi-transparent but runny. You can find it in a wide variety of colors, but it's not as flexible with media like FW and Sumi.

**Dr. PH Martin's** India ink is semi-transparent and lovely for creating ombre effects. It's a waterproof ink that can gum up your nib if you're not careful to clean your nib during each break. The waterproof nature is ideal for mixed media art projects, though. **Dr. PH Martin's pen white is a must buy!** Best white I've used. It's very thick, so shake thoroughly before using. Add a few drops of water if it's too thick. Doesn't mix well with other brands.

Stay far, far away from Higgin's inks. Color isn't vibrant and the thin ink tends to bleed and feather on just about every medium.

The price difference between the cheap stuff and the nice stuff is negligible. Get the nice ink from the get-go.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-2-inkaccessories.jpg }}"/>

Sometimes inks and nibs give you trouble. You may want to consider investing in these accessories to help.

**Gum Arabic** is a great medium for regulating ink consistency. If the ink is bleeding or it's just too thick, add a few drops and mix right in.

**Gouache** is an opaque water-based paint ideal for mixing up just the right pigment for the job. Mix with water and gum arabic with a junk brush until you get a smooth cream-like consistency.

**Ink wells and containers** are ideal for inking up your oblique pen. Glass dappen dishes are traditional for ink mixing, but don't seal. If you plan on traveling with your ink or you have curious children, you'll want something you can close. [Small glass vials](http://www.specialtybottle.com/58dramclearshortieglassvialwblkcap.aspx) are perfect.

The jars above are wider than small viles, so I find I'm constantly tipping the jars to get enough ink on my nib. I use a piece of polymer clay to keep the jar at the perfect angle. I snatched this idea from fellow calligrapher, [Fozzy](http://thefozzybook.com/).

## PEN NIB

The pen nib is probably the scariest thing about all of your new supplies. What the heck is this? Let’s go over the anatomy to get you better acquainted.

# anatomy of a pen nib
<img src="{{ 2-supplies-3-anatomy-nib.png }}"/>

- Tip/point: the small point allows for hairline strokes
- Slit: it allows the ink to flow down towards the point
- Tines: they separate based on pressure, creating the iconic thicks and thins
- Shoulder: where the pen transitions from the shank to the tip
- Vent: this allows the ink to flow evenly downward towards the point
- Shank: It serves two purposes, to hold the nib in the pen and to house the ink.
- Tail/base: this is what goes into the nib holder. When purchasing new nibs/holders, make sure that they’re compatible with one another. Some nib holders are made for bigger/smaller nibs.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-4-nibsataglance.jpg }}"/>

I recommend that you purchase a few nibs as you start out. Pictured above are a few of my favorite nibs ranging from the super fine to the bold and sturdy. Each nib has a vastly different personality that yields different results.

You basically need to “date” your nibs to see if your personalities blend well together. I definitely have my favorites, but I switch out depending on the style I’m after. You’ll want to head over to your local art supply store or Paper & Ink Arts to explore your options. Since each nib is typically under $2, it’s nice to purchase an assortment.

Here’s the breakdown of recommended nibs and their strengths:

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-5-huntnibs.jpg }}"/>

Hunt nibs are among the most common around and a great brand to start with.

- **Hunt 22** – fine hairline with medium-bold drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands.
- **Hunt 56** – medium hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. A great nib for heavy hands and for rough surfaces. Best with thicker inks.
- **Hunt 101** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Great for heavy hands. I find this my go-to for Spencerian styling.
-  **Hunt 100** – superfine hairline with medium drama from the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. These nibs are fun, but expire quickly.
- **Hunt 103** – superfine hairline with medium-bld drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Retains enough ink for about 1-2 letters.
- **Hunt 108** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Expires quickly. Requires a crowquill holder. Fun for flourishwork.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-6-esterbrooknibs.jpg }}"/>

Esterbrook is not quite as common, but they're a lot of fun to mess around with. All ideal on a smaller scale.

- **Esterbrook 355** – fine hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands. This holds more ink than the Hunt 101 or 103, I tend to use this for writing out long thank you letters.
- **Esterbrook 354** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for light hands and smooth surfaces. Holds more ink than other small nibs, but still gives a lot of detail on a small scale.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-7-gillotnibs.jpg }}"/>

If you go to an art store with any selection of calligraphy supplies, you'll find these nibs. Gillot, much like Hunt, offers a lot of variety within their line of nibs.

- **Gillot 1068a** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, unpredictable surfaces and large scales. The nib is very rigid, perfect for print work (i.e. addressing envelopes).
- **Gillot 303** – superfine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Not recommended for rough surfaces.
- **Gillot 404** – medium hairline with light drama on the downstrokes. It's ideal for thick inks and heavy hands.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-8-brausenibs.jpg }}"/>

Most Brause nibs are for broad pen calligraphy like Italic and Gothic, but they have a few pointed pens that I love. These are my current go-to nibs for just about any  project.

- **Brause ef66** – fine hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy and light hands, larger scales, rough surfaces and runnier ink.
- **Brause 511** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. Perfect for both light and heavy hands. Great with runnier inks and hairline flourishes.
- **Brause 513** – fine hairline with light-medium drama on the downstrokes. Great for light hands, heavy hands, large and small scales.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-9-hirozebragnibs.jpg }}"/>

These two brands are a little bit harder to find, but they're equally fun to test out. They're not in tight rotation, but they're still great.

- **Hiro 40** – medium hairline with bold drama on the downstrokes. Ideal for heavy hands, huge scales, thick ink and rough surfaces.
- **Zebra G** – fine hairline with medium drama on the downstrokes. This is a favorite among a lot of calligraphers, but it's not my go-to. It's got a lot of flexibility and durability, perfect for heavy hands. Great with large scale pieces.

You’ll want to be sure to protect your nibs and store them in a small, protective container. Baby food jars, Altoid tins and tic tac boxes are all great options for housing your nibs.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-10-nibholder.jpg }}"/>

## NIB HOLDER

There are various types of holders: large plastic, large wood, oblique and small plastic.

Small plastic holders (far left) are easy to find. Because of their scale, It’s a different feel than regular pens, and forces your brain to approach the pen differently. One of the biggest hurtles in learning calligraphy is how to draw with the pointed pen. If you're struggling with changing your mindset from writing to drawing, I would recommend this holder. It works with Brause, Esterbrook and the small hunt nibs. The crowquill holder looks similar, but doesn't have a ball in the center of the holder.

You can find simple straight and ergonomic holders with a shellacked wood and metal teeth in the middle. They're great, accommodate every nib (besides crowquill) but are more of an investment. If you're a messy calligrapher, you'll find the wood cracks and chips with abuse.

The speedball straight holder is a great, cheap holder that accommodates just about every nib. If the nib is too loose, I wrap the base of the nib with a small piece of tape then insert. These holders are all plastic, clean easily and don't crack or chip.

Straight holders are ideal for upright angles and oblique holders are best suited for traditional or more dramatic calligraphy angles. I use both styles and holders interchangeably, though. The speedball holder (left) is inexpensive and suitable for both left and right-handed calligraphers. You can find some really neat handmade oblique holders at [John Neal Bookseller](http://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/133). The far right holder was inherited from my great-great grandfather. I love it, but I never use it.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-11-nibplacement.jpg }}"/>

Placing your nib in your holder is pretty straight forward, save for the holders with teeth. Place your nibs along the outside of the metal teeth. You can adjust them for a tighter or looser fit, depending upon your nib size.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-14-cleaners.jpg }}"/>

## CLEANER

Traditional calligraphers use ink cleaner, which is a mixture of glicerine and dishsoap. You can find that at your local art supply store. Fact is, it lasts forever but it’s terribly messy. Heaven forbid that your local toddler gets into it and spills its dark, inky contents everywhere! Alternatively, I use Clorox or baby wet wipes. They’re fantastic for cleaning nibs, wiping up mistakes (if using a coated paper) and they’re easily contained. It’s also likely that you already have them on hand.

<img src="{{ 2a-supplies-13-paper.jpg }}"/>

## PAPER

You can’t always pick the kind of paper that you work on, especially if you’re doing projects like addressing envelopes. Here are some of my favorite ink-friendly papers:

- Rhodia Pad (pictured left) - available gridded and plain
- Vintage Wallpaper, although not archival
- Scrapbooking Paper
- 100% cotton rag Paper (Moab, Strathmore, Mohawk)
- Watercolor Paper (great for a rugged texture)
- Metallic Paper
- Paper specifically for laser printing

Rule of thumb: if it’s high quality or coated, you’ll be happy with the results. And stay away from "Calligraphy" pads from the art supply store. That paper is better suited for broad-tipped calligraphy. You'll find your nib will skip with nearly each upstroke.

## ENVIRONMENT

Having the correct environment is more important than you might think. Here are some things you’ll want to think about as you set up your project space:

- Lots of elbowroom
- No table legs in your way
- A large scrap paper underneath your work
- Cleaner and paper towels at the ready
- Peace and quiet (light music?)
- Computer for spell checking (if needed)
- NO CARPET anywhere nearby if at all possible
- Wear an apron
- Roll up your sleeves
- Pull back your hair
- Plenty of good lighting
- Kids at bay

I try to run through this list as I work on any calligraphy project. I’ve been lettering for some time and know how frustrating it is to completely ruin a project because of a little distraction.  The stakes tend to grow quickly as a piece develops, and that’s when a toddler/husband/cat will sneak up behind you and bump your elbow.

### In this lesson, you will learn the basic anatomy of a letter and identifying the basic strokes in each letter.

# basic anatomy of the letter
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-1-basic-anatomy.png }}"/>

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, many of the letterforms mimic one another. There are basic shapes within the English alphabet that make up each letter: miniscules for lowercase letters and majuscules for uppercase letters. Mastering these strokes in muscle memory will allow you to be more consistent in your lettering and flourishes.

# basic miniscules
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-2-basic-miniscules.png }}"/>

## MINISCULES

Each lowercase letter in the alphabet (save a few rogues) uses at least one of these shapes. These shapes are written out in the 55º angle traditionally used in Copperplate calligraphy.

# basic anatomy of the stroke
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-5-stroke-anatomy.png }}"/>

Notice above where the thick lines transition to the thin lines. Be aware of where that starts to taper off and get ahead of it in your own practice. With each of the miniscule strokes, you always start at the top and work your way down.

# basic majuscules
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-3-basic-majuscules.png }}"/>

## MAJUSCULES

The uppercase characters aren’t nearly as predictable as the lowercase, but you’ll still find many of the same forms repeated throughout.

Uppercase letters of the alphabet in the Copperplate style are, in my mind, flourished versions of lowercase letters. They often have similar basic structure to the lower case letters, but with a bit more majesty. So as you look at the basic structures that compose the uppercase letters versus the basic strokes that compose flourishes, you see a considerable amount of overlap.

# basic flourish strokes
<img src="{{ 3-strokes-6-basic-flourishes.png }}"/>

## BASIC FLOURISH STROKES

Flourishes can be broken down into 3 basic shapes. Once you have the shapes down commited to muscle memory, it’s not hard at all to combine.

I approach combining each basic stroke much like a choreographer would combine basic dance steps to create a ballet. We’ll talk more about flourishes, later.

### In this lesson, you’ll learn basic techniques on how to properly hold the pen and how much ink to use.

One of the biggest hurtles of learning calligraphy is learning how to use the pointed pen. For some, this comes naturally; for others there’s nothing more frustrating. Of the students that I’ve taught over the years, the ones who pick up the lettering fastest are the ones that recognize the difference between writing with a ballpoint pen and drawing with a pointed pen.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-1-hold-correct.jpg }}"/>

## HOLDING THE PEN

Think back to when you were learning to print your name in primary school. My teachers emphasized holding the pencil correctly. This technique is the same in calligraphy. Pick the pen up near the nib with your index and thumb. Allow the top of the pen to rest on the knuckle of your index finger. The bottom of the pen will rest on the bone between the tip and the joint of your middle finger. You should be holding your pen at about a 40º angle from the paper.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-1-hold-incorrect.jpg }}"/>

DO NOT hold the pen in a vice grip (see above for what NOT to do). It’s nearly impossible to achieve the correct angle to allow the tines to separate on the downstrokes and to avoid skipping on the upstrokes.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-4-angled-nib.jpg }}"/>

## ANGLE OF THE NIB

You want to make sure that the shoulders of the nib are always pointing downward, the shank’s curvature is pointing upwards.

The direction of your pen should point parallel to your downstroke. When using the straight holder you will be more naturally inclined to write at a more upright angle. To change to a more dramatic angle comfortably, rotate your paper more dramatically counter-clockwise or switch to an oblique holder.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-3-pressure.jpg }}"/>

## PRESSURE

You’ll be so surprised at how little you have to press on the paper in order to make a mark. Gravity is working with you, so all you have to do to make a hairline stroke is to touch the fibers of the paper (just a little) and move your pen. As long as you have enough ink on your nib, you should barely be grazing the paper as you make your upstrokes.

Clearly you want to press harder as you make your down strokes. You want to leave the tines behind as you press and drag. This will allow the ink to spread between the two lines and make the wide marks. You’ll be surprised at how much abuse your pen can take, but be warned, you want to keep your pen at the 40º angle when doing the down strokes. If your pen is too upright as you make your wide strokes, your tines will bend permanently.

<img src="{{ 4-pointedpen-2-inked-pen.jpg }}"/>

## INK


When inking up your nib, you want to make sure you have the right amount of ink; not too much and not too little. Dip your nib into the ink well about 1/8th of an inch past the shoulders. As you take the nib out of the well, tap the excess ink off the shoulders once or twice.


When you first start out, you’ll want to make preliminary marks on a scratch sheet of paper to see how much or little ink is on your nib. Also, if it’s the first time that you’re inking your nib, the ink will likely try to pull off the nib. This is because there’s a fine layer of oil covering your nib. Clean it off with a wet wipe or ink cleaner before you get started.


If you find your nib is not making a mark, clean off your nib with the wet wipe and dip again. Also, try scratching at the paper. The downside to using waterproof ink is that it can dry and harden at the point, creating a block in the flow. Scratch the dried ink off of the tip to restore flow.

Practice your miniscules as many times as it takes to get familiar with the pen. If you’re having a hard time getting it right, upload your project to the assignment [gallery](/#!/gallery). I’ll help you troubleshoot.

### In this lesson, you will learn the basic directions on how to take the miniscules and majuscules from the previous lesson and incorporate them into forming the words. You will practice the letters with both a pencil and the pointed pen.

Now that you have your basic strokes worked out, you’ll want to move onto forming the actual letters. You’ll find that the letters in the copperplate style are not much different than the cursive letters you practiced in school. Cursive originated from Copperplate calligraphy, so thank the third grade for making this much easier.

# character map
<img src="{{ 5-letterforms-1-character-map.png }}"/>

When forming your letters, typically uppercase, it might be a little tricky to figure out where to start. As a general rule of thumb, you start from the top left corner and work your way down. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but as you practice on your worksheet, you’ll find that even the rogue letters do follow a similar pattern as far as the construction is concerned.

Much like pronouncing a word with the right emphasis on each syllable, thick strokes emphasize and give structure to your lettering.

# incorrect emphasis
<img src="{{ 5-letterforms-2-emphasis.png }}"/>

Notice how changes in emphasis affect the letterform. Keep this in mind as you learn to deconstruct each letter and look for clues on where to start each stroke.

### In this lesson, you will learn the importance of spacing the letters evenly.

Once you feel comfortable with your letterforms, making the jump to writing out words and sentences is only natural. As you add letters to form words, try to visualize one or two letters ahead.  Try to see where your pen needs to go to link the letters. This will help you to avoid mistakes. 


As you continue to each letter of a word, you’ll recognize a certain flow occurs. Be mindful of that flow and keep it consistent. This is called kerning. Keeping your letter-spacing consistent will work wonders to your lettering as you figure out your own personal style.

# correct letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 6-wordforms-1-letterspacing-correct.png }}"/>


Changing up your kerning for different projects will vastly change the way your lettering feels and reads.

# incorrect letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 6-wordforms-2-letterspacing-incorrect.png }}"/>


Helpful tips in keeping kerning consistent:


Keep the same speed as you write out each letter. My mantra (thanks Phil from Modern Family) is Slow is Smooth and Smooth is Fast. Work slowly through each letter and you’ll find that mistakes happen a lot less frequently.


As you start a project, you’ll want to pencil out your letters very lightly. From here you can fix the letter-spacing to keep the project consistent. When you finalize it with the pointed pen, you’ll find yourself stressing less and focusing more on perfecting the thick and thin strokes.

### In this lesson, you will learn the basics of appropriately adding flourishes to a word or project as well as the basics to make your own impromptu flourish shapes.

Flourishes are a fun way to add a lot of punch to a project. I look at flourishes like the dessert course of a fantastic meal. Flourishes are best when used in small doses like at the beginning or end of a word.

# where to put flourishes
<img src="{{ 7-flourishes-3-placement.png }}"/>

There are three places that work best for adding flourishes:

1. for punctuation or crossing t’s and dotting i’s
2. at the beginning and/or ending of a word or line
3. underneath or around a word or phrase


Flourishes should add more dynamics to the word or phrase, not decrease readability. Use flourishes in small doses.

# basic flourishes
<img src="{{ 7-flourishes-1-basic-flourishes.png }}"/>

The basic flourish strokes as seen above can be added with one another in a wide variety of ways.

# examples of flourish combinations
<img src="{{ 7-flourishes-2-combining-basic-strokes.png }}"/>

Above are some examples of how to incorporate the basic flourish strokes with one another. When writing with ornate styling, I typically steer away from dramatic thicks and thins in flourishes to create a hierarchy between the word and the flourish.

Modern calligraphy is whatever you want it to be. With the basics of Copperplate, you have the tools to infuse your own personal style and writing into something fantastic. Depending upon the kind of person you are (do you change handwriting “fonts” every day?), this can be surprisingly easy or extremely challenging.

To get going on your on personal style, ask yourself a few questions and write out your rules in the form of practice phrases.

## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF
### These questions are meant for you to find your style and determine the look and feel you’re hoping to achieve with that style.

# baseline
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-1-baseline.png }}"/>

The straight baseline reads more formal and the curvy baseline, more informal. When using the curvy baseline, you do want to mark out where the general line is to keep the word from curving downward or upward.

# ascenders
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-2-ascenders.png }}"/>

# descenders
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-3-descenders.png }}"/>

Figure out what your ascenders and descenders are doing. Are they big and loopy? Short and narrow? This feeds into the feeling of your style, but doesn’t necessarily lean your letters more formal or casual. If I’m working on a project with multiple lines, I’ll typically make my ascenders and descenders shorter.

# thickness
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-4-thickness.png }}"/>

The thickness of your stroke depends upon the scale and type of nib you’re using. Thick downstrokes are great for projects that will need a big impact.

# width
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-5-width.png }}"/>

I choose my width based on the project I’m doing and how I want it to fill the space given.

# letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-7-letterspacing.png }}"/>

I choose my letter spacing based on the project. Wide letter spacing tends to be more casual.

# angle
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-6-angle.png }}"/>

The more upright  my letters are, the more casual they appear. Letters leaning to the right are a lot easier to draw than letters leaning to the left. I wouldn’t recommend experimenting with left-leaning letters until you’re proficient and comfortable with the traditional angle of letters.

# ornamentation
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-8-ornamentation.png }}"/>

Ornamentation goes back to the flourish section. Adding flourishes quickly formalizes your style. When working on the flourishes, make sure that you take into consideration the spacing, angling and thickness of your letters.

The biggest thing I can stress to making it yours is to create rules for yourself and STAY CONSISTENT. Consistency is key. Making calligraphy yours is something to work on once you get comfortable with the pointed pen. Don’t forget that getting good takes time and lots of practice. I love to see your progress! Upload your practice work to the [gallery](#!/gallery). Once you’re finished with the course, don’t stop practicing!

- Scans are okay, but to save me time from downloading and opening with a third party app, please snap a photo or **save as a JPG**. 

- Snapping a photo in natural light or a well-lit area will give me the most information to work off of. 

- Try to keep uploads to one page (or one photo) per assignment. Seeing the whole exercise at a glance helps me provide you with more feedback.

Addressing envelopes is so much fun, but there are a few rules that you might want to know to help make addressing letters (and in bulk) easy, look beautiful and get through the postal system. 

Most postal services are automated, so by hand-writing your address you’re automatically put into the “manually sort” pile. [The USPS](http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/addressing/deliveryAddress.htm) has some great suggestions, but most don’t apply to hand-lettered addresses. Here are my guidelines: 

*   Put the return address on the same side as the destination address if it ends up undeliverable. 
*   The address should be parallel (or mostly parallel) to the longest side.
*   Write no smaller than 1/8 inch tall.
*   Letter the important stuff simply.
*   Use high contrast with your paper and ink.
*   Hand-lettered mail pieces take much longer to deliver.

![address guidelines]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-1-intro-a.png }})

Below are guidelines (with some opinions from me) based on this article by the [USPS](http://pe.usps.com/text/qsg300/Q602.htm).

*   The return address takes up to 1/2 of the envelope’s width and 1/3 of the envelope’s height. 
*   The postage should be located at the upper right hand side of the envelope. 
*   The recipient’s address should be left justified on the lower two-thirds of the envelope. Traditionally I’ve found that each line gets indented, but that’s just what I employ with my style. 
*  1/2 inch spacing should be left at either side of the envelope and 5/8 inch at the bottom for handling and barcodes. 
*   It’s recommended that the ZIP remain on the same line as the City and State. I tend to keep it on there, but if it’s going to fit better on the next line, I’ll move it to the next line. 
*   Never forget to put Country information on there (even sender info) if sending an envelope to another country. I don’t tend to mess with what goes on what lines when sending an envelope to another country.

Deviations from these may not necessarily denote a letter as undeliverable, but may create delivery delays. 

I’ve found personally, that Chicago mail is a LOT less forgiving than other cities for fancy addresses. Mail times are doubled, sometimes tripled or returned for that area. 

 _If you have any experience good or bad with certain cities or states, let me know in the comments so I can add as much info here about mail times as possible, thanks!_

# Readability

![readability]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-14-readability.jpg }})

The most important aspect of lettering your envelopes isn’t style or composition, but readability. There are so many styles out there, and your style is uniquely you! Make sure that each letter reads correctly. 

In my experience, I’ve found the following letters (and numbers) often get mis-read: 

*  1 and 7 - they’re so hard to differentiate from each other. I’ve found that if I use a simple line for the 1 or add a base hairline to the 1, it doesn’t ever get confused for a 7. Conversely, I like to add a little flick at the beginning stroke of my 7 to differentiate it from 1.
*  U and V - Some Vs have a curved bottom, which can throw everything off. If you’re flourishing a curvy V at the exit stroke, you’ll want to keep those flourishes above the baseline as to avoid any confusion for the U. 
*  b and f and s - if you’re using a curved baseline, the b could easily be mistaken for an f. If you’re using an alternate f where the loop goes the opposite way, it could be easily mistaken for a loopy s. 

In the above pictures, I share my alternates that tend to read better when using non-traditional baseline and styles. This is all according to the book of Melissa and how I’ve seen things work. It’s certainly up to you how you deploy your own style in addressing envelopes. 

# Simply Lettered

![simple styling]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-2-sample.jpg }})

Simple styling is a-okay! With so much junk mail and chicken scratch, even the simplest address will make quite the impression. 

I’ve found that tight leading can be nice, but be careful of descenders and ascenders connecting and mucking up important information. You’ll see that above my P from Pike and R from ridge connect kind of awkwardly. Thankfully the intersection doesn’t affect readability, but I would re-do this address if I were lettering for a client. If this were the address of a thank you note or even for an invitation from me personally, I’d likely send as-is. 

Perfection is expected for client work, but not for personal work. According to the book of Melissa. 

# Ornamentation

![sample ornamentation]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-3-sample.jpg }})

Here’s another simple sample with slight ornamentation to the names only. You can go bananapants crazy on the names because that information isn’t crucial for the postman to know for delivery. It’s also a blast for recipients to see their name fancified. Win-win!

Above you can see that I’ve simply written out the address portion of each address (recipient and sender) in an all-caps print with slight shading on the downstrokes. It’s personal, unique, but easy for your postman to read. I like putting in little swirls here and there (not many, but note the N) for just a little flair of fancy. 

The red envelope is a mid-tone which would work just fine with either black, white -or in this case - silver. 

# Mixing Styles

![sample print]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-4-sample.jpg }})

The above, I used a brush for the first name and made it HUGE. then used a simple all-caps print with slight shading for the rest of the address. The large type and leading between lines makes the recipient’s address very clear to read.  

# Centered Text

![sample centered]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-5-sample-b.jpg }})

If I’m opting to put the return address on the back side, I’ll usually center the address. I do this if I’m not necessarily concerned with the mail being returned to me if it’s deemed undeliverable, but it’s really up to personal preference. 

**The piece on the left:** 
*  The name is larger
*  I’ve used heavy shading for the style element
*  Key address information is in a shaded all-caps
*  ZIP is on the same line, line is accentuated by dots on either side

**The piece on the right:**
*  The name is larger
*  I’ve used very little shading
*  Some flourishes used at the ends of the capitals
*  Key address information is in a Title Case print with similar styling as the script above
*  ZIP is on a separate line with hearts as a little detail on either side

# Loaded and Stacked

![sample stacked](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-addressingenvelopes-5-sample.jpg)

What do you do when you have a narrow envelope and a *really* long address? I’ve found this to work effectively, write the street number large and stacking the street name to the same height as the number. It’s readable, it fits nicely within the composition and it’s different! 

For the sake of your postman, I wouldn’t recommend going super fancy or flourish-y with your style if you’re having to stack information like above. 

# High Contrast

![contrast](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-addressingenvelopes-6-contrast.jpg)

If you’re a little obsessed with collecting - and using - colorful inks, you’ll want to make sure that your envelope and ink have the most contrast possible. The image above doesn’t do the samples justice, but in person, the really fine hairline piece on the left is much easier to read than the much bolder gold on the right. 

The more contrast you can provide with the envelope and ink, the easier it’s going to be to read and the faster it’s going to reach the recipient. 

# Supplies

Through years of trial and error, I’ve found the following to be must haves when addressing envelopes: 

**A good high-quality envelope**

*  [Paper Source](http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/envelopes/envelopes.html) 
*  [American Crafts](http://www.americancrafts.com/default.aspx?PageID=49&CategoryID=16)
*  [Envelopes.com](http://www.envelopes.com/)

I’m not familiar with all brands of envelopes, but Paper Source and American Crafts make great envelopes that can handle ink. I’ve found that GreenGrocer Kraft envelopes do well with ink (not all kraft envelopes are good with ink). 

Mowhawk, Cougar and Moab are fine paper companies that make high-quality papers that will work with ink. 

I’ve also found that coated metallic envelopes are typically awesome with ink and quite forgiving (to the point where you can literally wipe off mistakes if you catch them early enough!). 

**Brilliant Inks**

[Windsor & Newton Gouache](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+wnser1.html) - mix any color under the sun with some water, gouache and a little gum arabic (the gum arabic helps consistency and lengthens drying time). Watercolor could be used as well, but gouache’s opacity and thickness do well on just about any paper type.

[Dr Martin’s Pen White](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+penwht.html) - this white ink is thick and brilliant. You may need to thin it out with a few drops of water, but it’ll shine brightly on any dark surface. 

[Dr. Martin’s Iridescent Copperplate Gold](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+irides---gld.html) - FW and Windsor & Newton golds don’t compare to Dr. Martin’s copperplate gold. It’s bright on any surface and it doesn’t gunk up your fine nibs quite like other brands do. The gold flecks settle quickly so lots of shaking is required. 

[Finetec Arabic Gold](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+arabic.html) - you can get a whole gold pallete, but if you’re not sure how you’re going to like it, you can get refill pots for about $4 each. Add water with a small brush and apply to the underside of the nib. It’s a bright, bright metallic that needs no shaking.

**Drying Rack**

Simply placing the envelope on a flat surface until it’s dry is totally fine. However, if you’re addressing more than 10 envelopes at a time, you may want to get some help to keep that precious desk space clear. 

![drying rack]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-15-drying-rack.jpg }})

I found this mail sorter coil at my local thrift store for next to nothing. The rack makes all the difference when I’m doing multiple lettering projects at once. 

Beware, however. If you’re using really thin ink that tends to drip, you may want to find a more horizontal solution for drying organization. Make a test piece to find out if the above applies to any project. 

**Rulers**

You’ll want a clear gridded ruler for making marks on dark envelopes. I’ve found quilting rulers to do the trick, but that’s because it’s what I had on-hand. You’ll want something with a clear grid for making easy parallel lines like [this one](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+cthrul.html).

**Light Table**

If you’re lettering a lot on plain papers or envelopes and you don’t want to mess with penciling out your guides, use a [light table](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KNHRH6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KNHRH6&linkCode=as2&tag=il0c6-20). I don’t use mine often, but when I do, it’s such a huge time saver. 

# Guidelines

Most of my letters are addressed by hand without guides. I’m usually deploying an organic style that lends itself towards organic baselines and spacing or I’m in a hurry. Or both. But when I want my lines to come out the same every time, I have a method for that. 

![white ruled]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-7-rulers-white.jpg }})

With white or light colored envelopes that may be semi-transparent, I’ll cut a sheet of cardstock just shy of the width of my envelope opening and about 2-3 inches taller. 

From the bottom, I’ll line up my grid to the bottom of the sheet and measure up at least 5/8 of an inch. From there I’ll measure every quarter of an inch or so. This may vary depending upon the style and size of the envelope you’re using. 

![white ruled]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-8-rulers-white.jpg }})
 
I’ll slip the paper in the envelope, making sure that the bottom of my guide is square with the bottom of the envelope. Then I’ll letter as planned. If the paper is a little less transparent, you may be able to deploy this method in conjunction with a light table. 

![rulers white]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-9-rulers-white.jpg }})

With the guides set in place, you’re ready to address as many invitations as you need without penciling in any lines. 

If you’re struggling with consistent x-height, leading and slope of your letters, you may want to make a guide sheet with all of that information on there. 

But what if you have an envelope that’s so opaque a light box won’t make a difference? Get your ruler out. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-10-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Get your ruler out and mark the bottom baseline. Here I’m deploying a slanted baseline. I just eyeball where I want that to go for the first line, then slowly move my ruler up and use the parallel guides to make each line. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-11-rulers-dark.jpg }})

As you letter your guides, you may want to make more than necessary. Be sure to lightly mark your paper for easy erasing afterward. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-12-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Letter your piece and allow ink to dry completely before erasing. If you’re using a coated envelope with non-waterproof ink, you may want to wait a little longer than normal to erase guidelines. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-13-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Erase those little lines and BAM, the recipient won’t have a clue the awesomeness that’s about to head their way.

### Here are a few extra tidbits about calligraphy that are good to know. Have I forgotten anything? Email me at [melissa@melissaesplin.com](mailto:melissa@melissaesplin.com)

## THE DIGITAL WORLD

A lot of my calligraphy projects end up in a digital format in one way or another. How do I do this? It all depends.

If I’m looking for a crisp, smooth look, I use my Intuos 4 wacom tablet to write directly in Adobe Illustrator. There are many ways to use the Illustrator tools provided to create calligraphy, but that’s another lesson for another course.

If I want my calligraphy to look rough and hand-drawn, I’ll letter it on paper and scan it. When scanning work into the computer, I scan at 1200-2400 DPI. It sounds completely ridiculous, but if you plan on vectorizing those raw details, you’ll need as much information on that scan as possible. I use the Canon Pixma 970 for scanning and printing.

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND INSPIRATION

There are a lot of great books out there regarding copperplate calligraphy that will be great resources as you embark on your new craft. Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy is a very thorough (albeit traditional) resource. Calligraphy in the Copperplate Style is a quick guide with lots of gorgeous samples.

I also find it most helpful to follow the blogs of other calligraphers, both traditional and modern. Man cannot survive in a vacuum, so I suggest getting involved in the calligraphy community.  Seriously!  Get to know other calligraphers and learn their tricks. Join the I Still Love Calligraphy facebook group! It's a private group just for ISLC alumni. Request to join [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/384322728341174/).

Here are a few of my favorite modern calligraphers and letterers:

## PRICING OUT WORK

Calligraphy is so hot right now! Every blogger, party planner and designer is looking for a calligrapher. So what happens if they ask you to give them a quote on your work? This is a tricky situation, but here’s some advice:

1. Do NOT work for free. You need to charge something, even if you’re a complete amateur and it’s a small amount. If you do end up doing a project for free, let your family member, soul sister or charity know what you would have charged them. By doing so, you protect the industry and educate those around you not to expect this kind of work for free. My two cents: I love what I do, but I like to feed and clothe my children. You should, too.
2. Get a clear idea of what the project entails and give a quote based on how many hours you project the project to take. What I charge for Calligraphy work is similar to what I charge for design work. Design students charge anywhere from $15-30 per hour. Design professionals charge (or should charge) anywhere from $50-200 per hour.
3. Be clear on what clients should expect. There’s nothing worse than pouring time and energy into a project only to find out that they want you to do it again, because they weren’t expecting your style. I clearly state to my clients that they get what they get unless they have made their requirements known beforehand. I also charge extra for revisions (unless I spell something wrong).

This course is clearly not focused on how to monetize your calligraphy skills; however, as your ability grows, you may be surprised by how many people want your help with their projects. Let me know if you have any other questions regarding professional work.

Thanks so much for taking my online course. I do hope this class was helpful! If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know!

Cheers,
