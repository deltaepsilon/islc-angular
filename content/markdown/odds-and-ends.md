### Here are a few extra tidbits about calligraphy that are good to know. Have I forgotten anything? Email me at <a href="mailto:melissa@melissaesplin.com">melissa@melissaesplin.com</a>.

## THE DIGITAL WORLD


A lot of my calligraphy projects end up in a digital format in one way or another. How do I do this? It all depends.


If I’m looking for a crisp, smooth look, I use my Intuos 4 wacom tablet to write directly in Adobe Illustrator. There are many ways to use the Illustrator tools provided to create calligraphy, but that’s another lesson for another course.


If I want my calligraphy to look rough and hand-drawn, I’ll letter it on paper and scan it. When scanning work into the computer, I scan at 1200-2400 DPI. It sounds completely ridiculous, but if you plan on vectorizing those raw details, you’ll need as much information on that scan as possible. I use the Canon Pixma 970 for scanning and printing.

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND INSPIRATION


There are a lot of great books out there regarding copperplate calligraphy that will be great resources as you embark on your new craft. Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy is a very thorough (albeit traditional) resource. Calligraphy in the Copperplate Style is a quick guide with lots of gorgeous samples.


I also find it most helpful to follow the blogs of other calligraphers, both traditional and modern. Man cannot survive in a vacuum, so I suggest getting involved in the calligraphy community.  Seriously!  Get to know other calligraphers and learn their tricks. Join the I Still Love Calligraphy facebook group! It's a private group just for ISLC alumni.

## PRICING OUT WORK


Calligraphy is so hot right now! Every blogger, party planner and designer is looking for a calligrapher. So what happens if they ask you to give them a quote on your work? This is a tricky situation, but here’s some advice:

<ol>
    <li>
        Do NOT work for free. You need to charge something, even if you’re a complete amateur and it’s a small amount. If you do end up doing a project for free, let your family member, soul sister or charity know what you would have charged them. By doing so, you protect the industry and educate those around you not to expect this kind of work for free. My two cents: I love what I do, but I like to feed and clothe my children. You should, too.
    </li>
    <li>
        Get a clear idea of what the project entails and give a quote based on how many hours you project the project to take. What I charge for Calligraphy work is similar to what I charge for design work. Design students charge anywhere from $15-30 per hour. Design professionals charge (or should charge) anywhere from $50-200 per hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be clear on what clients should expect. There’s nothing worse than pouring time and energy into a project only to find out that they want you to do it again, because they weren’t expecting your style. I clearly state to my clients that they get what they get unless they have made their requirements known beforehand. I also charge extra for revisions (unless I spell something wrong).
    </li>
</ol>


This course is clearly not focused on how to monetize your calligraphy skills; however, as your ability grows, you may be surprised by how many people want your help with their projects Let me know if you have any other questions regarding professional work.


Thanks so much for taking my online course. I do hope this class was helpful! If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know!
