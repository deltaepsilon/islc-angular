Addressing envelopes is so much fun, but there are a few rules that you might want to know to help make addressing letters (and in bulk) easy, look beautiful and get through the postal system. 

Most postal services are automated, so by hand-writing your address you’re automatically put into the “manually sort” pile. [The USPS](http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/addressing/deliveryAddress.htm) has some great suggestions, but most don’t apply to hand-lettered addresses. Here are my guidelines: 

*   Put the return address on the same side as the destination address if it ends up undeliverable. 
*   The address should be parallel (or mostly parallel) to the longest side.
*   Write no smaller than 1/8 inch tall.
*   Letter the important stuff simply.
*   Use high contrast with your paper and ink.
*   Hand-lettered mail pieces take much longer to deliver.

![address guidelines]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-1-intro-a.png }})

Below are guidelines (with some opinions from me) based on this article by the [USPS](http://pe.usps.com/text/qsg300/Q602.htm).

*   The return address takes up to 1/2 of the envelope’s width and 1/3 of the envelope’s height. 
*   The postage should be located at the upper right hand side of the envelope. 
*   The recipient’s address should be left justified on the lower two-thirds of the envelope. Traditionally I’ve found that each line gets indented, but that’s just what I employ with my style. 
*  1/2 inch spacing should be left at either side of the envelope and 5/8 inch at the bottom for handling and barcodes. 
*   It’s recommended that the ZIP remain on the same line as the City and State. I tend to keep it on there, but if it’s going to fit better on the next line, I’ll move it to the next line. 
*   Never forget to put Country information on there (even sender info) if sending an envelope to another country. I don’t tend to mess with what goes on what lines when sending an envelope to another country.

Deviations from these may not necessarily denote a letter as undeliverable, but may create delivery delays. 

I’ve found personally, that Chicago mail is a LOT less forgiving than other cities for fancy addresses. Mail times are doubled, sometimes tripled or returned for that area. 

 _If you have any experience good or bad with certain cities or states, let me know in the comments so I can add as much info here about mail times as possible, thanks!_

# Readability

![readability]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-14-readability.jpg }})

The most important aspect of lettering your envelopes isn’t style or composition, but readability. There are so many styles out there, and your style is uniquely you! Make sure that each letter reads correctly. 

In my experience, I’ve found the following letters (and numbers) often get mis-read: 

*  1 and 7 - they’re so hard to differentiate from each other. I’ve found that if I use a simple line for the 1 or add a base hairline to the 1, it doesn’t ever get confused for a 7. Conversely, I like to add a little flick at the beginning stroke of my 7 to differentiate it from 1.
*  U and V - Some Vs have a curved bottom, which can throw everything off. If you’re flourishing a curvy V at the exit stroke, you’ll want to keep those flourishes above the baseline as to avoid any confusion for the U. 
*  b and f and s - if you’re using a curved baseline, the b could easily be mistaken for an f. If you’re using an alternate f where the loop goes the opposite way, it could be easily mistaken for a loopy s. 

In the above pictures, I share my alternates that tend to read better when using non-traditional baseline and styles. This is all according to the book of Melissa and how I’ve seen things work. It’s certainly up to you how you deploy your own style in addressing envelopes. 

# Simply Lettered

![simple styling]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-2-sample.jpg }})

Simple styling is a-okay! With so much junk mail and chicken scratch, even the simplest address will make quite the impression. 

I’ve found that tight leading can be nice, but be careful of descenders and ascenders connecting and mucking up important information. You’ll see that above my P from Pike and R from ridge connect kind of awkwardly. Thankfully the intersection doesn’t affect readability, but I would re-do this address if I were lettering for a client. If this were the address of a thank you note or even for an invitation from me personally, I’d likely send as-is. 

Perfection is expected for client work, but not for personal work. According to the book of Melissa. 

# Ornamentation

![sample ornamentation]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-3-sample.jpg }})

Here’s another simple sample with slight ornamentation to the names only. You can go bananapants crazy on the names because that information isn’t crucial for the postman to know for delivery. It’s also a blast for recipients to see their name fancified. Win-win!

Above you can see that I’ve simply written out the address portion of each address (recipient and sender) in an all-caps print with slight shading on the downstrokes. It’s personal, unique, but easy for your postman to read. I like putting in little swirls here and there (not many, but note the N) for just a little flair of fancy. 

The red envelope is a mid-tone which would work just fine with either black, white -or in this case - silver. 

# Mixing Styles

![sample print]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-4-sample.jpg }})

The above, I used a brush for the first name and made it HUGE. then used a simple all-caps print with slight shading for the rest of the address. The large type and leading between lines makes the recipient’s address very clear to read.  

# Centered Text

![sample centered]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-5-sample-b.jpg }})

If I’m opting to put the return address on the back side, I’ll usually center the address. I do this if I’m not necessarily concerned with the mail being returned to me if it’s deemed undeliverable, but it’s really up to personal preference. 

**The piece on the left:** 
*  The name is larger
*  I’ve used heavy shading for the style element
*  Key address information is in a shaded all-caps
*  ZIP is on the same line, line is accentuated by dots on either side

**The piece on the right:**
*  The name is larger
*  I’ve used very little shading
*  Some flourishes used at the ends of the capitals
*  Key address information is in a Title Case print with similar styling as the script above
*  ZIP is on a separate line with hearts as a little detail on either side

# Loaded and Stacked

![sample stacked](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-addressingenvelopes-5-sample.jpg)

What do you do when you have a narrow envelope and a *really* long address? I’ve found this to work effectively, write the street number large and stacking the street name to the same height as the number. It’s readable, it fits nicely within the composition and it’s different! 

For the sake of your postman, I wouldn’t recommend going super fancy or flourish-y with your style if you’re having to stack information like above. 

# High Contrast

![contrast](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.melissaesplin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-addressingenvelopes-6-contrast.jpg)

If you’re a little obsessed with collecting - and using - colorful inks, you’ll want to make sure that your envelope and ink have the most contrast possible. The image above doesn’t do the samples justice, but in person, the really fine hairline piece on the left is much easier to read than the much bolder gold on the right. 

The more contrast you can provide with the envelope and ink, the easier it’s going to be to read and the faster it’s going to reach the recipient. 

# Supplies

Through years of trial and error, I’ve found the following to be must haves when addressing envelopes: 

**A good high-quality envelope**

*  [Paper Source](http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/envelopes/envelopes.html) 
*  [American Crafts](http://www.americancrafts.com/default.aspx?PageID=49&CategoryID=16)
*  [Envelopes.com](http://www.envelopes.com/)

I’m not familiar with all brands of envelopes, but Paper Source and American Crafts make great envelopes that can handle ink. I’ve found that GreenGrocer Kraft envelopes do well with ink (not all kraft envelopes are good with ink). 

Mowhawk, Cougar and Moab are fine paper companies that make high-quality papers that will work with ink. 

I’ve also found that coated metallic envelopes are typically awesome with ink and quite forgiving (to the point where you can literally wipe off mistakes if you catch them early enough!). 

**Brilliant Inks**

[Windsor & Newton Gouache](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+wnser1.html) - mix any color under the sun with some water, gouache and a little gum arabic (the gum arabic helps consistency and lengthens drying time). Watercolor could be used as well, but gouache’s opacity and thickness do well on just about any paper type.

[Dr Martin’s Pen White](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+penwht.html) - this white ink is thick and brilliant. You may need to thin it out with a few drops of water, but it’ll shine brightly on any dark surface. 

[Dr. Martin’s Iridescent Copperplate Gold](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+irides---gld.html) - FW and Windsor & Newton golds don’t compare to Dr. Martin’s copperplate gold. It’s bright on any surface and it doesn’t gunk up your fine nibs quite like other brands do. The gold flecks settle quickly so lots of shaking is required. 

[Finetec Arabic Gold](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+arabic.html) - you can get a whole gold pallete, but if you’re not sure how you’re going to like it, you can get refill pots for about $4 each. Add water with a small brush and apply to the underside of the nib. It’s a bright, bright metallic that needs no shaking.

**Drying Rack**

Simply placing the envelope on a flat surface until it’s dry is totally fine. However, if you’re addressing more than 10 envelopes at a time, you may want to get some help to keep that precious desk space clear. 

![drying rack]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-15-drying-rack.jpg }})

I found this mail sorter coil at my local thrift store for next to nothing. The rack makes all the difference when I’m doing multiple lettering projects at once. 

Beware, however. If you’re using really thin ink that tends to drip, you may want to find a more horizontal solution for drying organization. Make a test piece to find out if the above applies to any project. 

**Rulers**

You’ll want a clear gridded ruler for making marks on dark envelopes. I’ve found quilting rulers to do the trick, but that’s because it’s what I had on-hand. You’ll want something with a clear grid for making easy parallel lines like [this one](http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?yhst-131221940731303+qJkSPN+cthrul.html).

**Light Table**

If you’re lettering a lot on plain papers or envelopes and you don’t want to mess with penciling out your guides, use a [light table](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KNHRH6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KNHRH6&linkCode=as2&tag=il0c6-20). I don’t use mine often, but when I do, it’s such a huge time saver. 

# Guidelines

Most of my letters are addressed by hand without guides. I’m usually deploying an organic style that lends itself towards organic baselines and spacing or I’m in a hurry. Or both. But when I want my lines to come out the same every time, I have a method for that. 

![white ruled]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-7-rulers-white.jpg }})

With white or light colored envelopes that may be semi-transparent, I’ll cut a sheet of cardstock just shy of the width of my envelope opening and about 2-3 inches taller. 

From the bottom, I’ll line up my grid to the bottom of the sheet and measure up at least 5/8 of an inch. From there I’ll measure every quarter of an inch or so. This may vary depending upon the style and size of the envelope you’re using. 

![white ruled]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-8-rulers-white.jpg }})
 
I’ll slip the paper in the envelope, making sure that the bottom of my guide is square with the bottom of the envelope. Then I’ll letter as planned. If the paper is a little less transparent, you may be able to deploy this method in conjunction with a light table. 

![rulers white]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-9-rulers-white.jpg }})

With the guides set in place, you’re ready to address as many invitations as you need without penciling in any lines. 

If you’re struggling with consistent x-height, leading and slope of your letters, you may want to make a guide sheet with all of that information on there. 

But what if you have an envelope that’s so opaque a light box won’t make a difference? Get your ruler out. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-10-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Get your ruler out and mark the bottom baseline. Here I’m deploying a slanted baseline. I just eyeball where I want that to go for the first line, then slowly move my ruler up and use the parallel guides to make each line. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-11-rulers-dark.jpg }})

As you letter your guides, you may want to make more than necessary. Be sure to lightly mark your paper for easy erasing afterward. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-12-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Letter your piece and allow ink to dry completely before erasing. If you’re using a coated envelope with non-waterproof ink, you may want to wait a little longer than normal to erase guidelines. 

![rulers dark]({{ 9-addressingenvelopes-13-rulers-dark.jpg }})

Erase those little lines and BAM, the recipient won’t have a clue the awesomeness that’s about to head their way.


As you upload your work to the gallery, please use the following guidelines for the best feedback:

- Scans are okay, but to save me time from downloading and opening with a third party app, please snap a photo or **save as a JPG**. 

- Snapping a photo in natural light or a well-lit area will give me the most information to work off of. 

- Try to keep uploads to one page (or one photo) per assignment. Seeing the whole exercise at a glance helps me provide you with more feedback.

- Be descriptive! Include information on **nib**, **ink**, **paper**, any issues or concerns and if you're a **lefty**. I can give more specific feedback based on those details.
