Modern calligraphy is whatever you want it to be. With the basics of Copperplate, you have the tools to infuse your own personal style and writing into something fantastic. Depending upon the kind of person you are (do you change handwriting “fonts” every day?), this can be surprisingly easy or extremely challenging.

To get going on your on personal style, ask yourself a few questions and write out your rules in the form of practice phrases.

## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF
### These questions are meant for you to find your style and determine the look and feel you’re hoping to achieve with that style.

# baseline

The straight baseline reads more formal and the curvy baseline, more informal. When using the curvy baseline, you do want to mark out where the general line is to keep the word from curving downward or upward.

# ascenders

# descenders
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-3-descenders.png }}"/>

Figure out what your ascenders and descenders are doing. Are they big and loopy? Short and narrow? This feeds into the feeling of your style, but doesn’t necessarily lean your letters more formal or casual. If I’m working on a project with multiple lines, I’ll typically make my ascenders and descenders shorter.

# thickness
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-4-thickness.png }}"/>

The thickness of your stroke depends upon the scale and type of nib you’re using. Thick downstrokes are great for projects that will need a big impact.

# width
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-5-width.png }}"/>

I choose my width based on the project I’m doing and how I want it to fill the space given.

# letter-spacing
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-7-letterspacing.png }}"/>

I choose my letter spacing based on the project. Wide letter spacing tends to be more casual.

# angle
<img src="{{ 8-makeityours-6-angle.png }}"/>

The more upright  my letters are, the more casual they appear. Letters leaning to the right are a lot easier to draw than letters leaning to the left. I wouldn’t recommend experimenting with left-leaning letters until you’re proficient and comfortable with the traditional angle of letters.

# ornamentation

Ornamentation goes back to the flourish section. Adding flourishes quickly formalizes your style. When working on the flourishes, make sure that you take into consideration the spacing, angling and thickness of your letters.

The biggest thing I can stress to making it yours is to create rules for yourself and STAY CONSISTENT. Consistency is key. Making calligraphy yours is something to work on once you get comfortable with the pointed pen. Don’t forget that getting good takes time and lots of practice. I love to see your progress! Upload your practice work to the [gallery](#!/gallery). Once you’re finished with the course, don’t stop practicing!


As you upload your work to the gallery, please use the following guidelines for the best feedback:

- Scans are okay, but to save me time from downloading and opening with a third party app, please snap a photo or **save as a JPG**. 

- Snapping a photo in natural light or a well-lit area will give me the most information to work off of. 

- Try to keep uploads to one page (or one photo) per assignment. Seeing the whole exercise at a glance helps me provide you with more feedback.

- Be descriptive! Include information on **nib**, **ink**, **paper**, any issues or concerns and if you're a **lefty**. I can give more specific feedback based on those details.

      Answer the above questions and figure out a style that you’d like to work with. Write out a word or phrase. The phrase, “The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog” uses all of the letters in the alphabet. Practice to make your angles, baseline, kerning, descenders, ascenders and strokes consistent. Upload your work to the <a href="#!/gallery">gallery</a> for critique.
